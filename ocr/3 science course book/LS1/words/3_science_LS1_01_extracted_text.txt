Just as the computer and other machines are made up of different parts, the
human body is also a ‘living machine’ composed of different parts. These parts
of the body perform different functions.

Let us learn about the human body, its parts and their functions.

Structure of the Human Body

Look at the picture of a wall. What are the single
units that make up a wall called?

The wall is made of many bricks joined together.
Similarly, the human body is made up of millions of
tiny structures called cells. Cells are the smallest units
of the body. Cells are of different types. Cells of the
same type join together to form a tissue. Different tissues join together to form
an organ, and different organs join together to form an organ system. Different
organ systems work together to make the body perform different activities.

Read the sentences and answer the questions.

Jenny received a beautifully wrapped birthday gift.
When she opened the ribbons, the wrapping paper
and the box, she found a storybook inside it.

1. What was seen from outside?

2. What was present inside?

Just as the gift had ribbons and wrapping paper outside and a storybook
inside, our bodies have some parts that are seen from the outside and some
other parts that are present inside.

Most of our organs are present inside the body. They are called the internal
organs. The heart, stomach, kidneys, lungs and brain are some internal organs. @g,

The skin and the nose are present on the outer side of the body. They are
the external organs. The eyes and the ears are partially external and partially
internal organs.

Organ Systems

Different organ systems that make up a human body are the skeletal system, the
muscular system, the digestive system, the circulatory system, the respiratory
system, the nervous system, the excretory system and the reproductive system.

Let us learn more about these organ systems.

The skeletal system

What is the first thing that we will make if
we want to make a toy horse? What will give
shape to the toy horse? What will make the
toy horse stand straight? Look at the picture
and discuss the answers to these questions.

While making a toy horse, we make a frame first.

The frame is covered by coloured pieces of cloth.

The frame remains inside and provides support to the toy
horse. Similarly, human beings too have a framework of
bones inside the body called the skeleton.

The skeleton gives shape and support to the body.
It also protects the internal organs.

The skeletal system consists of 206 bones.

The muscular system

While making the toy horse, we used

plays an important role in the body.

The heart, along with blood and blood vessels,
makes up the circulatory system. The heart

is made up of muscles and pumps blood to
different parts of the body through the

blood vessels.

The blood carries oxygen and useful substances
to all parts of the body. Waste generated by the
body is also carried by the blood to the organs

that help in removing the waste from the body.

Let us perform an activity to understand how lungs work.

Inflate a balloon by blowing air into it. Now, hold the
neck of the balloon and let the air escape.

What do you observe?

The lungs are like balloons. They expand when we breathe
in air and contract to push out the air through the nose.

The respiratory system helps take in oxygen gas that the body needs to function
properly. It also helps in removing carbon dioxide gas from the body. Carbon
dioxide gas is a waste that is produced in the body.

Just as the computer and other machines are made up of different parts, the
human body is also a ‘living machine’ composed of different parts. These parts
of the body perform different functions.

Let us learn about the human body, its parts and their functions.

Structure of the Human Body

Look at the picture of a wall. What are the single
units that make up a wall called?

The wall is made of many bricks joined together.
Similarly, the human body is made up of millions of
tiny structures called cells. Cells are the smallest units
of the body. Cells are of different types. Cells of the
same type join together to form a tissue. Different tissues join together to form
an organ, and different organs join together to form an organ system. Different
organ systems work together to make the body perform different activities.

Jenny received a beautifully wrapped birthday gift.
When she opened the ribbons, the wrapping paper
and the box, she found a storybook inside it.

2. What was present inside?

Just as the gift had ribbons and wrapping paper outside and a storybook
inside, our bodies have some parts that are seen from the outside and some
other parts that are present inside.

Most of our organs are present inside the body. They are called the internal
organs. The heart, stomach, kidneys, lungs and brain are some internal organs. @g,

Organ Systems

Different organ systems that make up a human body are the skeletal system, the
muscular system, the digestive system, the circulatory system, the respiratory
system, the nervous system, the excretory system and the reproductive system.

Let us learn more about these organ systems.

The skeletal system

What is the first thing that we will make if
we want to make a toy horse? What will give
shape to the toy horse? What will make the
toy horse stand straight? Look at the picture
and discuss the answers to these questions.

While making a toy horse, we make a frame first.

The frame is covered by coloured pieces of cloth.

The frame remains inside and provides support to the toy
horse. Similarly, human beings too have a framework of
bones inside the body called the skeleton.

The skeleton gives shape and support to the body.
It also protects the internal organs.

The skeletal system consists of 206 bones.

The muscular system

While making the toy horse, we used
coloured cloth over the framework of
sticks joined by threads. Similarly, our
body has muscles covering the framework
of bones.

The muscular system consists of about 600
muscles. Muscles are the soft and fleshy parts
of the human body. They are attached to our
bones. Muscles expand and contract and help us in doing various

Do you know, the actual shape of the human
heart is not as you have drawn above? The heart
plays an important role in the body.

The heart, along with blood and blood vessels,
makes up the circulatory system. The heart

is made up of muscles and pumps blood to
different parts of the body through the

blood vessels.

The blood carries oxygen and useful substances
to all parts of the body. Waste generated by the
body is also carried by the blood to the organs

that help in removing the waste from the body.

Let us perform an activity to understand how lungs work.

Inflate a balloon by blowing air into it. Now, hold the
neck of the balloon and let the air escape.

What do you observe?

The lungs are like balloons. They expand when we breathe
in air and contract to push out the air through the nose.

The respiratory system helps take in oxygen gas that the body needs to function
properly. It also helps in removing carbon dioxide gas from the body. Carbon
dioxide gas is a waste that is produced in the body.
