What do these pictures tell you?
Discuss.

Our bodies need energy to work and carry out various activities. This energy
is derived from the food we eat. Food also helps the body grow, makes bones
and muscles strong, and protects the body from many diseases.

The process of obtaining food and utilising it for the various needs of the
body is called nutrition.

The food that we eat contains useful substances
called nutrients. There are five types of
nutrients present in the food. They are proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals.
Each nutrient has a particular function.

Some provide energy to the body, others help

to grow and repair worn out cells and tissues.

. =» There are some nutrients that help the body
Our body needs food. to fight diseases. The body needs all these
nutrients. Since the amount of nutrients is different in different types of food,
it is important that we eat all types of food.

Let us learn about the different components of food.

Proteins

Read the poem and identify the nutrient.

‘Pass me the peas, please.’

Richie said to Mum.

‘Oh Richie, they’re tasty!’

Terry said happily.

‘Eggs! They’re for me!’

Incy exclaimed next, as

Nancy cooked on the frying pan.
Solve the clues to know the nutrient!

Peas and eggs are rich in proteins.
How do proteins help us?

BON Proteins help to build the body. They are needed for the

Chicken, egg, fish, milk and pulses are rich in
proteins. Foods containing proteins are called
body-building foods.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates give us energy. Starch and sugar
are types of carbohydrates.

Foods such as rice, wheat, maize, bajra, sugar
and potatoes are rich in carbohydrates.

Fruits, green leafy vegetables, milk and fish are some foods rich in vitamins
and minerals.

Vitamins and minerals help the body fight
diseases. Hence, food items rich in vitamins
and minerals are called protective foods.

Some vitamins and minerals help to
make our bones and teeth strong. Some
are essential for the normal growth and
development of the body. Vitamins and
minerals should, therefore, form a part of e “CANS “60:

is called obesity, which may lead to many diseases.

Let us understand what roughage Is.

Take a piece of apple and chew it till it becomes
tasteless. Swallow the juice only.

You will notice that some part of the apple is left in your
mouth after you swallow the juice.

This is the roughage.

Roughage is the fibre present in the food. We get
roughage from salads, fruits and vegetables such
as cabbage and spinach.

Water

Along with food, the body needs about 3 to 4 litres of
water daily, as nearly 70 per cent of the human body
is made up of water. Water helps the body to function
well. It helps in digesting food, throwing out waste
and maintaining the body temperature.

Foods that Should be Eaten Raw

Some vegetables such as tomatoes,
onions, cucumbers, radishes and
carrots should be eaten raw. If cooked,
most of the vitamins present in them
are lost.

Food items that are eaten raw must,
however, be washed properly. This
helps in removing germs and dirt.

Fresh and Rotten Foods

We must eat fresh food. Fresh food is good for our health. Eating stale or rotten
food can cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea. There are many factors that lead to
food spoilage. For example, foods spoil if the weather is hot or if the food is not
stored properly.

Here are some tips that can help us identify if the food is fresh or rotten.

e Fresh food has a healthy appearance. Rotten food, on the other hand, may
be discoloured and slimy to touch.

« Fresh food has a pleasant smell, while rotten food may have a strong and
unpleasant smell.

« Fresh food tastes good, while rotten food may taste sour or bitter.

Different people have different food choices. Some factors on which the
food preferences of people depend are given below.

Age: Elderly people may like to eat food items that are soft and easy to
chew. Similarly, a baby without teeth eats food items that can be swallowed
without chewing.

Occupation: An athlete generally eats carbohydrate-rich food as he/she
requires more energy while playing a sport.
Availability: People living in coastal areas generally eat a lot of fish and
other seafood as these foods are easily available.

Individual preferences: Some people prefer to eat vegetarian food, while
some others prefer to eat non-vegetarian food.

Kitchen garden

Grow your own food in your kitchen garden. You can grow fruits, vegetables and
herbs in your backyard, on the terrace, windowsill or even in pots. Some of the
plants that can be grown in a kitchen garden are tomato, brinjal, chilly, onion,
lady's finger, bitter gourd, coriander, peppermint, basil, lemongrass, etc.

Start easy with coriander plants that can be used in various dishes:

1. With the help of an adult, take some moist soil in a pot. You can even use a
milk carton or a plastic bottle as the pot.

2. Scatter some coriander seeds evenly in the pot and cover them with a thin
layer of soil. Make sure that the seeds are far enough apart.

3. Place the pot in an appropriate place to receive
sufficient sunlight.

4. Keep the soil moist by sprinkling water as needed.
5. The seeds germinate in about 2 weeks.
You can use freshly cut coriander leaves in salads!
