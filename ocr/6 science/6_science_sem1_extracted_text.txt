FOOD AND NUTRIENTS

What will happen to a car if it runs out of
petrol? Its engine will stop. Petrol is the fuel
that burns in a car engine and supplies it with
energy. Similarly, your body also needs fuel to
keep it working. The fuel you use is called food.

To keep a car engine running properly, it
should be supplied with the nght amounts of
fuel and oxygen. Without a proper balance of
these two substances, the engine will not run
smoothly and may even stop. In the same way,
to keep your body working properly, it must be
supplied with the right amounts of the right
chemicals in food. The chemical substances in
food that your body needs are called nutrients.

Functions of food
Food has three main functions:
* It provides energy for various activities of
the body.
+ It helps the body to grow and replace worn-
out cells.
* It protects the body from various diseases
and keeps it fit and healthy.

Variety of food in India —

India is a vast country with different types of
soil and climate which determine the crops,
vegetables and fruits that grow best in a
place. People in different regions of India cook
differently. These factors mean that the food

ACTIVITY 1 (Collecting and analysing
information)
Name two of your classmates who come from
states different from yours. Find out what
they eat every day. In what ways is their
food different or similar to yours?
culture in various regions of the country is
different.

Ingredients of food

A basic food dish such as boiled rice is
made by boiling rice in water. This food has
only two ingredients—nice and water. Chicken
biryani, however, is made up of rice, water,
chicken, salt, several spices and vegetable
oil. It has several ingredients. Where do we
get these ingredients from? We get them
mainly from plants and animals. However,
water and salt are two ingredients obtained
from the earth.

SOURCES OF FOOD
We get food from plants and animals. You know
that green plants prepare their own food from
non-living things—carbon dioxide, water and
sunlight—found in the environment. Green plants
are known as producers. They prepare more
food than they need. The extra food is stored in
different parts of the plant as shown on page 7.
We get the following foods from animals.

~ Milk, e.g. from cow, buffalo, goat and camel.
Milk is used to prepare milk products such
as cheese, butter, ghee, curd and ice-cream.

* Eggs, e.g. from hen, duck and quail.

+ Meat, e.g. from hen, duck, goat, fish and
crab.

« Honey from honeybees. Honeybees collect
nectar from flowers and take it to their
hive. There they convert it into honey and
store it as food. We get honey from the
beehives.

ACTIVITY 2 (Collecting information): :

To find out the ingredients and sources of your food
Make a list of food items brought for lunch by your frends. Find out the ingredients used to
make each of them. Also find out the sources of these ingredients. Fill in a table as shown.

What do you find? Except salt and water, we get the ingredients from either plants or animals.

ACTIVITY 3 (Experimental investigation): To sprout some seeds

Take some seeds of moong or chickpea. Soak them overnight in water.

Drain out the water the next day and wrap the seeds in a wet cloth.

Keep the cloth wet by sprinkling water on it. Observe the seeds after

one day. Has a small white structure grown out of the seeds? The seeds
have sprouted. The white structure will develop into the root of a seedling.
You can wash the sprouted seeds and eat them raw. You can also boil the

sprouted seeds, add salt and spices and make a tasty snack.

FOOD HABITS OF ANIMALS
Animals cannot prepare their own food. They
depend directly or indirectly on plants for their
food. Different animals eat different kinds of
foods. Their body parts are adapted to the kind
of food they eat.

Herbivores are animals that eat plants.
Buffaloes, cows, deer and horses are herbivo-
rous animals. They have sharp, cutting teeth in
front and flat, grinding teeth at the back.

Carnivores are animals that eat the flesh
of other animals. Lions, tigers, wolves, dogs,

IT’S A FACT!

The teeth of herbivores have to do a lot
of grinding, as a result of which their teeth
are constantly being worn away. However,

this is not a problem for them as their
teeth Keep growing continuously.

snakes, eagles and vultures are carnivores.
The animals have long, sharp teeth and the
birds have strong, pointed beaks to tear the
flesh. Snakes have small teeth, which are used
only to help in swallowing the prey as a whole.

FIG. 1.2 Carnivores eat flesh.

FIG. 1.3 Omnivores eat both plants and animals.

Omnivores are animals that eat both plants
and animals. Humans are omnivores. Bears,
crows and cockroaches are also omnivorous
animals. Some carnivores and omnivores, known
as scavengers, mainly consume dead bodies
of animals and help to keep the surroundings
clean. Some examples are crows, jackals, hyenas
and vultures.

Parasites are small animals that depend on
other living animals for their food. Mosquitoes
live on blood that they suck from humans and
other animals. A mosquito has a long, sharp
pipe instead of teeth, which is used to pierce
the skin and suck the blood. Fleas, leeches and
bugs are also parasites. Some parasites such as
tapeworm, roundworm and hookworm live inside
the bodies of animals and eat the food after it
has been digested by the animals.

PLANTS
GRASSHOPPER FROG

FIG. 1. 4 cavenders mainly eat dead bodies of animals.

FOOD CHAIN
A grasshopper eats a green plant, a frog eats
the grasshopper, the frog is eaten by a snake,
and the snake is eaten by an eagle.

This chain of events is called a food chain-
A food chain shows how each living thing gets —
its food in a particular environment.

The study of food chains also shows us the
interdependence of various organisms in that
environment. In a grassland, the following food
chain exists: grass — zebra — lion

A typical food chain in a pond is:
algae (small plants) — small fish — large fish

Note that all food chains begin from green
plants. What does this mean? It means that —
all animals are dependent on green plants for
food—either directly or indirectly.

OUR HERITAGE

Several decades back India did not produce enough food grains and was dependent on
imports to feed the people. In 1963, high-yielding wheat seeds were introduced in India.
Also, modern farming methods began to be used. This brought about considerable
increase in wheat production and India became self-sufficient in food grains.

This increase in food grain production is known as the Green Revolution.

Dr M. S. Swaminathan is known as the ‘Father of the Green Revolution in India’.

Components of Food

You already know that our food has different
chemical substances called nutrients. These
nutnents can be grouped into the following
classes:
¢ carbohydrates « fats ¢ proteins
¢ vitamins « minerals

Nutrients are essential for good health. It
is important that our food includes all these
nutnents in sufficient quantities. Besides these
nutrients, our body also needs water and
roughage.

CARBOHYDRATES
Sugars and starch are carbohydrates. They are
nutnents that give us quick energy. Sugars are

ALMONDS

FIG. 2.2 Some sources of fats

carbohydrates are normally stored in the body
as fats.

FATS

There are many different kinds of fats. Our
body uses fats as an energy store. Fats are
stored under the skin and around the heart
and kidneys. When we are short of energy, our
body uses these fats. Fats actually contain more
energy than carbohydrates. The fats stored in
our body also help to keep us warm.

Fats are obtained from both plants and
animals. Butter and ghee are animal fats.
Groundnut oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil,
mustard oil, other vegetable oils, and nuts such
as almonds or cashewnuts, are obtained from
plants. Meat, fish, eggs and cheese are also
good sources of fats. An adult requires about
70-80 grams of fats per day.

PROTEINS
Our body is made up of billions of cells. These
cells are made mainly from proteins. When we

FIG. 2.3 Some sources
of proteins

IT’S A FACTI

Eating too much fat is not good for us.

If we eat too much animal fat, it gets deposited
in the lining of our blood vessels. This makes
our blood vessels narrower. Our heart then has
to work harder to push the blood through
the blood vessels. This can increase
the risk of heart problems.

grow, our body needs proteins to make new
cells. Our body also needs proteins to replace
old and damaged cells. Our diet should have
enough proteins for this. Growing children and
sick people require more proteins in their diet.

Like fats, proteins are also obtained from
both plants and animals. Pulses and soyabeans
are plant proteins. Meat, fish, eggs and milk
are animal proteins. The total requirement of
proteins for an adult is about 50-60 grams per
day (about 1 gram per kilogram body weight).
Children have growing bodies and hence require
more proteins per kilogram body weight.

FIG. 2.5 Meat, fish and eggs are good sources of
proteins and they also provide us with fats.

VITAMINS

Vitamins are a group of nutrients that our
body requires in small quantities. They are
essential for the proper working of the body.
If our diet is lacking in any vitamin, we
suffer from certain diseases called deficiency
diseases. There are about 20 known vitamins.
The important vitamins, their sources,
importance, and the deficiency diseases
caused when we do not get enough, are given
in Table 2.1.

MINERALS
Minerals are nutrients that contain certain
elements. All of them perform particular
functions in the body. They are required by
our body in small quantities in the diet to
maintain good health. Their deficiency in our
diet also leads to deficiency diseases. Table 2.2

IT’S A FACT!
At the time when vitamins were discovered, their
chemical compositions were not known. Hence,
they were represented by letters of the English
alphabet. Scientists now know their chemical
composition and have given them chemical names.
Vitamins are now manufactured by drug companies
and are available at drug stores. They are given
to patients suffering from deficiency diseases.

lists some important minerals, their sources,
importance and deficiency diseases.

WATER
Water makes up almost 70 per cent of our body
weight. Most of this water is present in the cells
of our body. Some water lies in spaces between
the cells. Also, water constitutes the liquid part
(called plasma) of the blood. Life processes
cannot occur without water.

Water plays a vital role in the body's system.
+ It helps our body absorb nutrients from food.
~ It transports nutrients throughout the body.
~ It collects wastes from different parts of
the body, and removes them from the body
in the form of urine and sweat. Sweat is
mainly water.
< The body is cooled by evaporation of sweat
from the skin.

You lose a lot of water every day as you
breathe, sweat, cry or get rid of your wastes.
About half of this water is replaced by the
water in the food you eat. Fruits and vegetables
contain large quantities of water. Grapes, for
example, contain 80 per cent water. Also, water

IT’S A FACT!
If the body of a person loses too much water, for
example, while playing or working in the hot sun,
his body may get severely dehydrated. This causes
the blood to become thicker and its movement
in the body slows down. The consequences are
severe pain and cramps in the muscles.

The other half is replaced when you drink
liquids. Most people need 6-8 glasses of water
or other liquids every day to stay healthy.
Athletes and sportspersons should drink enough
water to replace the water they lose through
sweating.

Even though it is vital for our body, water
does not provide any energy. It only serves as a
solvent in which all chemical reactions take place.

ROUGHAGE
Plant foods such as fruits and vegetables
contain a carbohydrate that cannot be digested
by the body. It is called roughage. It should
form an important part of our diet because of
the following reasons:

« Roughage adds bulk to our food. Since it
is not digested, it passes down the entire
digestive tract from the mouth to the anus.
The muscles of the digestive tract need
this bulk to push against—like squeezing
toothpaste out of a tube.

~ It prevents constipation and ensures proper
bowel movement.

“ Many doctors believe that a high-fibre
diet reduces the risk of heart diseases and
bowel cancer.

TESTING FOR NUTRIENTS

ACTIVITY 1 (Experimental investigation):
Testing for starch

Take a small quantity of the food item (for example, |
bread). Using a dropper, add 2-3 drops of iodine |

solution to it. If the colour of the food item changes |

to blue-black, it contains starch.

ACTIVITY 2 (Experimental investigation):

Testing for sugar
Glucose is a kind of sugar our body uses the most.
Put some glucose into a test tube. Add a few drops
of Benedict's solution. Carefully heat the test tube
in a water bath. The colour of glucose will turn
orange. (Warning: Handle with care as Benedict's
solution is harmful.)

ACTIVITY 3 (Experimental investigation):
Testing for fat

Take a food item and rub it on a piece of brown
paper. Let the paper dry. If a translucent mark is
left on the paper, it means fat is present
in the food.

Put 4-5 drops of cooking oil into a test tube.
Add 2 mL of ethanol to the oil. Shake the

test tube. Add 2 mL of oil more to the test tube
and shake again. The oil turns cloudy,

(Warning: Handle with care as ethanol is
inflammable.)

ACTIVITY 4 (Experimental investigation):
Testing for protein
Take a piece of meat or some beans, mash it
with a mortar and pestle, and add a little
water to make a suspension. Take a little of this
suspension in a test tube. Add a few drops of
copper sulphate solution to it. Very carefully add
a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution. If the
solution becomes purple, it shows the presence
of protein. (Warning: Handle with care as sodium

| hydroxide is corrosive.)

ACTIVITY 5 (Experimental research)
Carry out the above tests on different food items
such as raw potato, groundnut, milk, uncooked
and cooked rice, uncooked and cooked pulses, slice
of a vegetable, slice of a fruit, boiled egg, etc
Find out which nutnents are present in these food
items. Tabulate your results.

ORAL QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

1. What classes of nutrients are needed by our body?
2. If you need quick energy, what kind of food will you depend on—sugary food, starchy food or

food full of vitamins? Why?

3. ‘Fats are used as an energy store by our body.’ What do you understand by this statement?

4. Whose requirement of proteins per kilogram body weight is greater—a 10-year-old child or a
24-year-old adult? Why? Why is ‘per kilogram body weight specified here’?
5. In which foods is roughage present—plant foods, animal foods or both? Give reasons.

NUTRIENTS IN SOME COMMON FOOD ITEMS
Each food item that you eat has several
nutrients—some in greater quantity, and others
in lesser quantity. The following will give you
an idea of the amount of major nutrients in
some foods that you eat every day.

* Cereals (wheat, rice) have maximun
carbohydrates (about 70 per cent), less protein.
(about 10 per cent) and small amounts -
vitamins and minerals. Cereals are, therefore
eaten with every meal to give energy. You musi
get most of your energy from carbohydrates.

+ In pulses, there are less carbohydrates
(60 per cent) than in cereals but more
proteins (20 per cent). They also have
vitamins and minerals. Pulses are a good
source of proteins especially for people who
follow a strict vegetarian diet.

= Fish, meat and eggs are good sources
of proteins. They also provide you with
fats.

= Milk and milk products are rich in the
mineral calcium, which is good for bones
and teeth. They also provide you with
vitamins.

< Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which is very
good for the eyes.

~ Spinach and cabbage are rich in vitamins
and minerals. They also provide you with
roughage.

~ Clarified butter (ghee), butter and oil are
100 per cent fats. They must be included in
your diet, but in limited amounts.

Food can be divided into the following
groups:

~ Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats provide
energy to the body and are known as
energy-giving foods.

“ Foods rich in proteins help our body to grow
and are known as body-building foods.

* Foods rich in vitamins and minerals are
known as protective foods. They protect
our body against diseases.

A balanced diet

To remain healthy you need all the nutrients
in the right amounts. No single food item
contains all the nutrients. Therefore, you need
a combination of food items. A balanced diet is
one that contains the proper amounts of each
nutrient. However, a balanced diet is not the
same for everyone. It depends on age, sex and
the type of work that one does.

~ In early childhood, the child grows rapidly.
He or she needs more proteins.

« Nursing mothers and pregnant women also
need more proteins to serve the needs of
the growing baby.

«- A hard-working labourer needs more energy,
which he can get by eating more fats and
carbohydrates.

Table 2.3 gives an example of a balanced
diet for a 12-year-old child.

are cooked before eating. Cooking makes the
food soft, tasty and easy to digest. But wrong
cooking methods destroy several nutrients in it.

Vegetables and fruits should not be washed
after cutting or peeling them. This results
in the loss of some vitamins and minerals.
Washing rice and pulses repeatedly also results
in the loss of vitamins and minerals.

Food should be cooked in just enough
water. Cooking in too much water and then
throwing the extra water away makes food lose
its nutnents.

Vitamin C gets destroyed during cooking due
to heat. We should therefore eat raw fruits and
vegetables to get vitamin C.

DEFICIENCY DISEASES

Many people in the world cannot afford a
balanced diet due to poverty. Some others do
not get a balanced diet because of wrong food
habits. For example, many children do not eat
green vegetables, which are full of vitamins and
minerals. Many people practise wrong cooking
habits which destroy the nutrients in food.

People who do not get the nght amounts
of all nutrients from their food suffer from
deficiency diseases. The effects of the deficiency
of different nutrients are discussed below.

Deficiency of carbohydrates

Most of the energy we need comes from
carbohydrates. About 320 g of cereals can
provide a 12-year-old with the energy he or she
needs per day.

If your diet gives less energy than required
by your body, it is deficient in carbohydrates.
People with carbohydrate deficiency in their
diet are weak and do not have enough
stamina. They cannot bear physical and mental
strain.

Eating too much of carbohydrates also leads
to ill-health. Most of the extra carbohydrates

are converted and stored as fat in the body,
This leads to an increase in the body weight,
This is called obesity. Overweight people are
not very active and often suffer from diseases
such as that of the heart.

Deficiency of proteins and fats
Deficiency of proteins in the diet leads to
severe malnutrition especially in children.

Kwashiorkor is a disease caused by protein
deficiency in children. The stomach becomes
swollen, the legs become thin and the skin
shows ugly patches. If the disease is not
treated in time, the mental and physical growth
of the child slows down.

Marasmus is a disease in children caused
by the deficiency of proteins, carbohydrates and
fats. The child becomes so thin that loose folds
of skin can be seen all over the body.

FIG. 2.6 A child suffering from marasmus

Deficiency of vitamins and minerals

Vitamins are called essential nutnents becaus
they are necessary for the normal developmen
and functioning of the body systems. The
regulate body activities.

Each vitamin is needed for a specifi
purpose. Deficiency of one or more vitamin
leads to deficiency diseases. These disease
affect the eyes, skin, bones, hair and genere
growth of the body. Table 2.1 lists a few o
these vitamins, and the deficiency disease
caused by the lack of these vitamins.

18 @ FOOD


Page nummber: 19
Like vitamins, minerals are needed by
the body in very small amounts. They are
supplied to our body in the form of salts by
various foods. Deficiency of minerals in a body
causes deficiency diseases. Table 2.2 shows the
important minerals required by our body and the
diseases caused by their deficiency in the body.

Let us study in detail about some deficiency
diseases caused by the lack of vitamins and
minerals in the diet.

Scurvy is a disease caused due to the lack
of vitamin C. The main symptoms of scurvy are
swelling and bleeding of gums, and wounds
not healing properly. In the 16th and 17th
centuries, sailors who went on long voyages
suffered from this disease, as they did not
get fresh fruits to eat during the voyage. In
the year 1747, a doctor named James Lind
discovered that if these sailors were given
lemons and oranges, the disease was cured very
quickly. This led to the discovery that scurvy
is a deficiency disease caused by the lack of
vitamin C.

Rickets is a disease of the bones. In
children suffering from rickets, bones become
soft and hence get bent and deformed. Bow
legs, pigeon-type chest, and bending of the
spine are symptoms of the disease. There may

FIG. 2.7 A child suffering from rickets has bow legs.

also be pain in the bones and loss of tooth
enamel. In adults, bones become bnittle and
can get fractured easily. Rickets is caused by
the lack of vitamin D and the mineral calcium.
Lack of the mineral phosphorus also affects
bones and teeth.

Anaemia is caused by the deficiency of iron
in the diet. It is a disease in which there is
deficiency of a substance (called haemoglobin)
found in the red blood cells of our body. Because
of this, the blood is unable to carry the full
supply of oxygen to cells of the body. A person
suffering from the disease looks pale, gets
tired quickly, and suffers from loss of appetite.
Another type of anaemia results from the lack of
vitamin B,,. In this disease there is a reduced
formation of red blood cells in the body.

Goitre is caused by the lack of the mineral
iodine in the diet. The thyroid gland situated
in the neck region becomes swollen, and there
is reduced production of a chemical (called
thyroxin) in the body that controls growth.
A child suffering from goitre shows slow or
retarded physical and mental growth. Goitre
used to be common among people living in
the Himalayan region in our country, as the
iodine content of soil and water is low in these
areas. However, consumption of iodized salt has
helped to reduce the incidence of goitre.

IT’S A FACT!
The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a Government
scheme where school-going children in India
are provided free nutritious food in their schools.
This scheme tries to solve two main problems—
~ malnutrition among children of the poor, and
improving attendance in schools. The scheme was
_ introduced in Madras (now Chennai) way back in
1925. It has now been implemented in all states
of India. So far 12 crore (120 million) children are
covered under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. It is the
largest school lunch programme in the world.

in mind.

¢ Energy content of food can be found by burning a measured quantity of food and measuring
the amount of heat liberated.

¢ Foods burn only when they are completely dry.

¢ An idea of the heat released on burning can be obtained by using it to heat water and
measuring the temperature rise.

¢ The following are some food items that can be compared—bread, chips, peanuts, fruits
(What will you do to dry them?)

¢ You will need to design the apparatus you will use to burn the food, use it to heat water in a
beaker, and measure the rise in temperature of water.

¢ You will also have to figure out how to minimize loss of heat to the surroundings.

HINTS: The container in which food is burnt should be small and light. Otherwise it will take
away a lot of heat and results will be inaccurate. The container can be made from wire gauge to
minimise this effect. For the same reason, the beaker used to heat the water should be small and
thin-walled. Food with water in them can be dried in the sun or in an oven at a low temperature
(If the temperature is high, food can get cooked).

Eating a balanced diet in a different region

A group of students plan to visit two different states of India. To get the real feel of these states, they
plan to eat only local food. You are their tour advisor. Pick out two states of India which are far away
from your state, which you think they should visit. Find out 4-5 main dishes eaten in these states and
their nutrient content. Now make a balanced diet for the students using these dishes.

TEACHER'S NOTES
Point out to students that deficiency as well as excess of any type of nutrient is bad for health. Being obese is also dangerous.
Let children realise that while some people suffer from malnutrition because they do not get enough to eat, others suffer because
they do not eat to keep their weight down. Discuss why this is as dangerous as not eating properly.
¢ Emphasize the importance of water and roughage in food, even though these are not nutrients.

CLOTHING MATERIAL—HISTORY

We wear clothes mainly to protect our bodies
against the weather—strong sunlight, extreme
cold or heat, and rain. Clothes also protect
us from insects. We also wear clothes to make
ourselves look smart. That is why many of us want
to wear clothes according to the latest ‘fashion’!
People in different regions of the world wear
different kinds of clothes. The kind of clothes
people wear mainly depends on the climate of
a place. The traditional clothes worn by people in
our country vary from region to region.

Clothing was invented between 50,000 and
1,00,000 years ago. Stitching needles made of
bones and ivory, about 30,000 years old, have
been discovered in Russia. Long ago people
covered their bodies with animal skins in cold

regions, and with bark, leaves and grass in
warmer regions. After the discovery of the
stitching needle, skins of animals were used to
make fitted clothes like trousers. When people
learned agriculture, they began weaving plant
material by hand to make cloth. In most places
they wrapped the cloth around themselves, like
san, lungi, sarong and turban till the use of
stitching needles became popular.

Activity 1 (Research)
In 1991, a preserved body of a human male
(nicknamed ‘Otzi the Iceman’) was found on

FiGseo <1.

Cotton is light and reasonably smooth. Wool is
fluffy. Silk is smooth and shiny. Synthetic cloth
is light and smooth. Jute is rough. Cotton,
wool, silk and synthetic cloth are the four main
materials from which clothes are made today.
Synthetic material is also often mixed with
cotton or wool.

Activity 3 (investigation)
Cut out a small piece r\
from cotton fabric, using
scissors. Can you see
loose thread or yarn at
the edges? Pull a few of
them out. Notice that —
the cloth is made up of
a number of such threads
woven together.

Press one end of the yarn with your thumb
and scratch the other end with your nails.
Does the yarn split up into thin strands?
Look at the strands through a magnifying
glass. You may be able to see that these thin
strands are made up of still thinner strands
called fibres.

3.2 Yarn and
strands

Thus you see that fabrics are made up of yarns,
and yarns are made up of fibres. There are
two kinds of fibres—natural and synthetic.
Natural fibres are obtained either from plants,
e.g. cotton and jute, or from animals, e.g-
wool and silk. Synthetic fibres are made from
other materials, mainly petroleum. In addition,
leather and fur are materials that are not fibres,
from which clothes are made. Leather and fur
are obtained from animals.

Cotton

Cotton is a soft fibre that grows around the
seeds of the cotton plant. The fruit of the
cotton plant is called cotton boll.

Activity 4 (Investigation)
Take some cotton wool. reg
Pull it apart and look eg
at the edges. You can
see the cotton strands,
which are made up of
cotton fibres.

Fic. 3.3 Strands in cotton wool

Cotton is a warm season crop requiring
moderate rainfall. It needs a fertile clayey soil
with good moisture holding capacity. Black soils
found in western India and southern India, and
alluvial soils of northern India are suitable
for growing cotton. In India, cotton is sown
between May and September in different parts of
the country. The harvesting begins from October.

Ginning: Cotton bolls burst open after maturing.
One can see the seeds covered with cotton
fibres. Fibres are then separated from the seeds
by combing. This process, called ginning, was
earlier done by hand. Nowadays, machines are
used. ‘Gin’ is an abbreviation for engine.
Spinning: The fibres are then spun into
yarn, by drawing out and twisting the fibres
together. This process of making yarn from
fibres is known as spinning.
Spinning was traditionally done in India
on a hand spindle (taki?) or on a spinning
wheel (charkha). Machines are now used.

See how long a yarn you can make in this way
without breaking it.

Weaving: A fabric is made up of two sets
of yarns arranged together. This is done by
weaving.

Weaving of fabrics is similar to weaving
two sets of strips of paper as shown in Activity
6. Two sets of yarns are arranged together in
different ways to get different patterns. This is
done on looms. These are either hand operated
(hand looms) or power operated (power looms).

Cotton cloth is soft and lets air in. It also
absorbs sweat. A cloth that lets air in is said
to ‘breathe’. The advantage of cotton cloth is
that the sweat it absorbs evaporates because of

the air it ‘breathes’. This results in the cooling
down of the body. Cotton clothes are, therefore,
comfortable to wear, especially in hot, humid
weather. Denim, a type of durable cloth used
to make jeans, is made from cotton.

History: Cotton has been used to make cloth,
especially in areas with tropical climates, for
thousands of years. Some historians are of
the opinion that the Egyptians used cotton
as early as 14,000 years ago. The earliest
written reference to cotton is from India.
Cotton has been grown in India for more than
3000 years.

Wool

Wool is the fibre derived from the hair of
sheep and some other animals. Removing
the wool from sheep using special clippers
is called shearing. After shearing, the wool
is packed in bales and transported to the
mills. Here it is cleaned and then combed by
a machine, separated and spun into fibre.
This fibre is then woven or knitted to make
woollen clothes.

Knitting and weaving are different. In
knitting, a single yarn is used to make a cloth
or fabric, but in weaving, two sets of yarns
are used. Knitting may be done by hand or by
machine.

Wool is fluffy and hence retains air. Since
air is a bad conductor of heat, wool has the
property of retaining heat. Clothes made from
wool are, therefore, worn in cold weather.

Fic. 3.8 Sheep shearing and knitting of wool

In addition to clothing, wool is used fo
carpeting, felt and upholstery.
History: Humans started domesticating sheer
and other animals long back and, the use
of wool for clothing and other fabrics date:
back to some of the earliest civilizations.
Today, Australia is the leading producer oj
wool in the world, followed by New Zealanc
and China. India is among the top ten woo
producers in the world.

Silk

Silk is obtained from the cocoon of the
silkworm. Silkworms are fed on the leaves
of the mulberry trees. Each worm spins a
continuous thread up to 800 metres long to
make a cocoon. The cocoon is boiled in water

Fic. 3.9 Silkworm and a cocoon

to kill the silkworm and then unwound t
get silk fibre. The rearing of the silkworm fo
production of silk is known as sericulture. Sil
is greatly prized because of its shimmerin
appearance.
History: Silk was first developed in Chine
possibly 5000-8000 years ago. From Chine
silk reached India, the Middle East, Europe an
Africa. This trade was so extensive that th
major set of trade routes between Europe an
Asia became known as the Silk Route.
Recently, silk has come under fire fro1
animal rights activists who maintain that th
common practice of boiling silkworms alive 1
their cocoons is cruel.

Jute

Jute is a long, soft, shiny plant fibre that
can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is
produced from the stem of the jute plants. Jute
+s one of the cheapest natural fibres. Some of
its useful properties are its biodegradability,
durability and strength. It is especially useful
for making strong packing material.

Jute grows best in warm, humid climates,
with plenty of rainfall. It grows best in alluvial
soil receiving silt from annual floods, as in
the Sunderbans delta in India and Bangladesh.
Jute is cultivated in the rainy season. Sowing
is done between February and May, depending
on the species. The crop is ready for harvesting
in 4-5 months.

Almost 85% of the world’s jute cultivation
is concentrated in the Sunderbans delta
(Ganges delta) in India (West Bengal) and
Bangladesh. It is also cultivated in Assam and
Bihar. India is the largest producer of jute
products in the world.

After harvesting, the stalks of the plants are
tied-into bundles and retted (soaked) in water
for about 20 days. This process softens the
tissues and permits the fibres to be separated.
The fibres are then stripped from the stalks
in long strands and washed in clear, running
water. Then they are hung up or spread out to
dry. After 2-3 days of drying, the fibres are tied
into bundles and sent to the mills.

Jute is the second most important fibre
after cotton. It is used chiefly to make cloth

Fic. 3.10 Jute plants and rope

SOME OTHER NATURAL FIBRES
Coir is a coarse fibre extracted from the fibrous
outer shell of a coconut. The coir fibre is relatively
water-proof and is one of the few natural fibres
resistant to damage by salt water. It is used
to make floor mats and doormats, brushes,
mattresses, sacking and ropes. The state of
Kerala produces about 60% of the total
world supply of coir fibre.

Silk cotton is a plant fibre obtained from the
Silky hairs that surround the seeds of the kapok
trees that grow in India and Malaysia. Silk cotton
is light and fluffy and is used for stuffing cushions
and mattresses. It is also used for sound
insulation. The oil obtained from the seeds Is
used in food and in the manufacture of soap.

for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make
sacks and coarse cloth. The fibres are also
woven into curtains, chair coverings, carpets,
hessian cloth, and backing for linoleum.

Synthetic fibres

Nylon and polyester are synthetic fibres.
They are actually plastics made from chemicals
that are obtained mostly from petroleum. The
plastic is first heated to melt it. It is then
forced through a device called a spinneret,
which contains fine holes. The long threads that
emerge from the holes are allowed to cool and
solidify. Several of these threads are twisted
together to make the yarn, which is then used
to make synthetic cloth.

Clothes made from synthetic fibres are
stronger and do not wninkle easily. They also
dry easily. But they have less air spaces in
them than natural fibres and do not ‘breathe’
so well. They also cannot absorb sweat. These
properties make them unsuitable for hot and
humid weather. They are often mixed with
natural fibres such as cotton or wool to make
cloth which has strength and can also breathe
and absorb sweat.

Cotton was known in India around 5000 years ago. Cotton fabrics recovered from the ancient

city of Mohenjodaro date back to 3000 BCE. These fabrics were well-preserved and kept in
silver vessels.

> We wear clothes to protect our bodies against the weather and insects, and to look good.
* Before clothes were invented, people covered their bodies with leaves, and skins of animals.
* Fabrics are made of yarns and yarns are made of fibres.
“> Fibres are either natural or synthetic.
* Natural fibres are obtained either from plants, e.g. cotton and jute, or from animals,
e.g. wool and silk.
«> Synthetic fibres are made from other materials, mainly petroleum.
* Cotton is a soft fibre that grows around the seeds of the cotton plant.
* Cotton clothes are good for hot and humid weather as they ‘breathe’, and absorb sweat.

* Black soil and alluvial soil are good for growing cotton.

of

* Shearing is the process of removing wool from sheep.

“> Wool is fluffy and retains air, and hence heat.

*> Silk is made from the cocoon of the silkworm.

* The rearing of silkworm for production of silk is called sericulture.

Jute fibre is coarse and strong, and is obtained from the jute plant.

Nylon and polyester are synthetic fibres. They are actually plastics made from chemicals
that are obtained mostly from petroleum.

* Synthetic cloth is strong and does not wrinkle easily, but it does not absorb sweat and does
not ‘breathe’ like cotton.

Waterproof cloth for raincoats and tents is made by coating fabric with a material called silicone
resin. The fabric is passed through the resin with the help of rollers. Heat is then applied to it.
This makes the resin coat the fabric evenly. This coating prevents the fabric from absorbing water.

WHAT ARE THINGS MADE OF?

You can see innumerable things around you.
They look different and have properties different
from each other. What are these things made
of? Let us consider your pencil. It is made of
wood, the ‘lead’ which is a combination of clay
and a substance called graphite, and paint. Your
eraser is made of rubber. Your book is made of
paper, ink and glue. A knife is made of steel and
wood, or steel and plastic.

Wood, steel, clay, graphite, paint, rubber,
paper, ink, glue and plastic are examples of
materials. Materials are used to make different
kinds of things or objects we use.

« Same material can be used to make different

kinds of things. For example, steel is use:
to make knives, utensils, cars, buildings
bridges, etc. Can you fill in the Table 4..

< Same object can be made from different
kinds of materials. For example, a

Table 4.2 with other objects that can be
made from different materials?

Taste 4.2 Same object made
from different matenals

OBJECT MATERIALS THEY ARE MADE OF

tumbler glass, plastic, thermocole, ceramic, paper

« Several objects can be made from a
combination of several materials. For
example, your pencil or your book.

What enables us to decide which maternal to
use to make a particular object? This depends
on two things—what we want to use the object
for; and the properties of the materials.

How materials are alike
We have talked about the large number of
things around us. As we know, they have
properties different from each other. However,
there are two properties which are common to
all these things.
~ All materials occupy space. The amount
of space something occupies is called its
volume. You occupy more space than this
book. So you have more volume than this
book. Even the things you cannot see, such
as air, Occupy space.
~ All materials have mass. The amount of
matter in an object is known as its mass.
It can be measured by using a balance.

WHAT IS MATTER?
We have seen that all materials occupy space
and have mass. All of them are made up of

matter. Anything that occupies space and has
mass is matter. It includes all substances of
which the universe is made up of.

The bones and flesh of your body, the
clothes you wear, the food you eat, the water
you drink and the air you breathe are all matter.

But then, what is not matter? Feelings of
love or sadness do not occupy space and do not
have any mass. They are not matter. Radio or TV
sets, or cellphones are matter. But the signals
they receive are not. Can you think of some
other things that are not matter?

What is matter made up of?

A piece of iron is matter. If an iron piece is
broken, what happens? It forms smaller pieces
of iron. If we continue breaking this piece of
iron, it becomes smaller and smaller. But this
must end somewhere. It should be possible to
get the smallest piece of iron that cannot be
broken any further. John Dalton, a scientist of
the nineteenth century, named this smallest
piece of iron, the iron atom. The smallest piece
of gold is a gold atom.

Atoms are so small that they cannot be
seen even by the most powerful microscope.
Approximately, 40 lakh gold atoms, placed end
to end, form a line only 1 mm long!

The smallest particle of gold and iron is the
atom. But the smallest particle of water is not
a water atom. Why? This is because water is
made up of two different kinds of atoms, the
atoms of hydrogen and atoms of oxygen. The
smallest particle of water contains two atoms of
hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. These form
one molecule of water.

Iron, gold, hydrogen and oxygen, whose
smallest particles are atoms, are called
elements. Substances, such as water, which
are made up of two or more elements are called
compounds (Table 4.3). The smallest particle of
a compound is a molecule.

There are about 118 different elements.
Ninety-two of these occur naturally on the
earth. The others have been made by scientists
in laboratories. Some common elements are:
hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, zinc, helium,
sodium, silicon, silver, carbon, gold, sulphur,
magnesium, phosphorus, nitrogen, aluminium
and mercury.

Think of atoms like the letters of the
alphabet. We group different letters to make
words. Thousands of words can be made from
just 26 letters. In the same way, atoms join
together to make molecules. Millions of different
kinds of molecules can be made from these 118
different kinds of atoms. That is why we see
millions of compounds all around us. Sugar,
chalk, vinegar, salt and water are all compounds
(Fig. 4.1). Their molecules are different from
each other. This difference in the molecules is
the reason why salt is ‘salty’ and sugar is ‘sweet’!

It is fascinating to see that atoms of two
gases, hydrogen and oxygen, can combine
together to form water, which is a liquid. Again,

CLASSIFICATION
Take a look around yourself and try to make a
list of things you can see. Are you able to list
everything you see?

That would be quite a task for there are
thousands and thousands of things around you.
Some of these things may be living while some
of them may be non-living. They may be of
different shapes, sizes and colours. They may be
made of same or different matenals. There are
even certain things that exist but you cannot
see, such as air and microscopic germs.

In what ways are the things you see
different from each other? In what ways are
they alike? Can you group things togethe
according to certain properties?

Acnvity 1 (Observation and inference)
Consider two groups A and B mentioned
below. How are things in Group A different
from those in Group B?

Group A: human, neem tree, pea plant, duck,
cockroach

Group B: pen, cellphone, watch, book, table

You will notice that Group A has Living
things whereas Group B has non-living things.

Grouping together things with simita
properties is called classification.

Although living things share some common
properties, they differ from each other in
several ways. Living things are further classified
into subgroups such as plants and animals.
Each of these can be further classified based
on certain properties. Animals can be classified
into groups like insects, fish, amphibians,
reptiles, birds and mammals. For example, all
insects have six legs. But each group differs
from other groups in some ways.

Acnviry 2 (Observation and inference)

human-made.

Point out the common properties in the
following groups of things:

Group C: exercise book, pen, pencil, eraser,
sharpener

Group D: petrol, kerosene, diesel, coal, wood,
gobar gas

Classification is not confined to living things.
Non-living things can also be classified in various
ways. It can be done on the basis of what they
are made of, or how they are used and whether
they are natural or human-made. Materials, such
as wood, cotton and jute occur naturally. However,
ceramic, plastic, glass and steel are human-made.

You can see various examples of how
classification is used to make our work easy at
home and at school.

Acnviry 4 (Investigation)
Go to your school library and see how the
books are arranged there. Are they arranged
according to the subjects? You can ask the
librarian. How does this arrangement help you
to find the book you need?

In the kitchen, all the utensils are kept
together, so are all the spices. If you want to
find turmenc in the kitchen, you do not have to
look everywhere. You just go to the shelf where
the spices are stored.

How do you think such a classification
helps?

PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

How would you describe an apple? You can talk
about its size, shape, colour or about how it feels
or smells. Size, shape, colour, texture (hard or
soft, smooth or rough) and smell are properties
of matter. All matter can be described by such
properties. The properties of materials decide
what things we can make out of them. For
example, we cannot make tools out of rubber as
it is not hard. We cannot make cooking utensils
out of wood as they will catch fire easily. Let us
study some important properties of matter.

Appearance
Paper looks different from cloth. Wood looks
different from iron. Iron looks different from
copper or aluminium. At the same time, there
are some similarities between iron, copper and
aluminium that are not there in wood or paper.
Materials can be classified on the basis of
their appearance.

Lustre
A metal spoon shines whereas a wooden spoon
does not shine so much. Silk cloth has a shine
whereas woollen cloth does not. We say that
metal has more lustre than wood and that silk
has more lustre than wool.

An iron rod may not appear Lustrous.
However, if you use sandpaper to remove the
top layer you will see that it is lustrous. Some

a. Solids do not change
shape or volume.

b. Liquids change

metals lose their lustre when exposed to air
and moisture.
Materials can be classified on the basis of

their lustre.

Texture
Different materials feel different when you
touch them, that is, they have different
textures. For example, metal is hard and smooth
whereas wool is soft and rough. Soft materials
can be compressed or scratched easily. Hard
materials are difficult to compress.

Materials can be classified on the basis of
their texture.

Acnviry 5 (Investigation)
Close your eyes. Ask your friend to collect
various materials like silk cloth, woollen cloth,
metal spoon, wooden spoon, glass tumbler,
plastic tumbler, etc. Touch these with your
eyes closed. Can you make out what material
each is made up of by touching?

State
Most materials can be placed into one of the
three groups: solid, liquid or gas.

Acnviry 6 (Observation and inference)
Classify the following as solid/liquid/gas:

¢ coin « book « oxygen ¢ petrol « stone

¢ water « hydrogen ¢ orange juice

c. Gases change shape

Fic. 4.4 States of materials

38 @ MATERIALS


Page nummber: 39
What is the difference between the three
states? The difference lies in the way they
change their shape and volume.

Solids do not easily change their shape or
volume. You can move a box from one place
to another but its shape and volume does not
change (Fig. 4.4a).

Liquids change shape but not volume.
Pouring milk from a jug into a tumbler causes
milk to take the shape of the tumbler. But you
still have the same amount of milk. Its volume
does not change (Fig. 4.4b).

Gases easily change their shape and volume.
If you pump air into a football, the air fills
the football and takes its shape. Its volume
changes. It takes up less space in the football
than it did outside the football (Fig. 4.4c).

Arrangement of molecules: All molecules
of a substance attract each other. The three
states of matter have different properties
because of differences in the arrangement of
molecules in them.

In solids, the molecules are very tightly
packed. As they are very close together, they
attract each other very strongly. This force of
attraction keeps them together. The positions
of molecules in a solid are fixed. They can only
vibrate about their fixed positions. This is why
solids have a definite shape and volume. Since
it is difficult to make the molecules move away
from each other, solids are rigid and hard.

In liquids, the molecules are less tightly
packed. Since the molecules are further away from

However, others such as honey or tar flow very

each other than in solids, they do not attract
each other so strongly. The positions of the
molecules in a liquid are not fixed. The molecules
can move around within the liquid. Liquids are
not rigid and do not have a definite shape.

In gases, the molecules are so far apart that
there is hardly any attraction between them.
Therefore, they move around independent of
each other. Hence, a gas has no fixed shape or
volume. The molecules move around in the full
space available to them. That is why a gas fills
up the space available to it.

Table 4.4 summarizes the properties of
solids, liquids and gases.

Solubility in water

Half-fill a glass tumbler with water. /
Add a teaspoonful of sugar to it, and

sugar? Why does it disappear?

We say that sugar has dissolved in water.
Actually, water causes all molecules in a solid
piece of sugar to break apart. The individual
molecules, when separated, are so small that we
cannot see them. We say that sugar is soluble
in water.

Gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide
are also slightly soluble in water. Plants and
animals living in water breathe oxygen dissolved
in water. Plants use carbon dioxide dissolved in
water for photosynthesis. Some gases, such as
nitrogen, are however not soluble in water.

LIQUIDS

Thus, matter can be classified on the basis
of its solubility in water.

Density—floating and sinking

If you drop an iron nail in water, it will sink.
But a piece of wood will float on water. If you
weigh equal volumes of iron, water and wood,
you will find that iron is the heaviest and wood
is the lightest. An equal volume of aluminium
will be lighter than iron but heavier than water.
It will sink in water. An equal volume of cotton
will be lighter than water. It will float on water
if placed on wax paper.

The mass per unit volume of a substance
is known as density. A substance (iron,
aluminium) which is denser than wate:
will sink in water. A substance (wood, cotton)
which is less dense than water will float or
water.

Matter can be classified on the basis o'
whether it floats or sinks in water, that is, or
the basis of whether its density is less than o
more than that of water.

OUR HERITAGE
Kanada was a sage who lived in India in the 6th century BCE. He originated the idea that
anu was the smallest indestructible particle of matter, much before Dalton gave his theory of
the atom.

An interesting story states that one day Kanada was nibbling some food and throwing away
small food particles. It suddenly occurred to him that there must be a smallest particle of food
and he could not divide that particle into further parts. Thus evolved the idea of a particle of
matter which could not be divided further.

3 John Dalton (1766-1844) This British chemist developed a theory that all
elements are composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms and that each
element is made up of identical atoms. This came to be known as Dalton’s
Atomic Theory.

Dalton was also interested in studying the weather. He was colour blind and did
a serious study of the causes of colour blindness. Find out more about Dalton’s
life and work.

G Acharya Kanada (6th century BCE) is considered to be the founder of
atomic theory. It was Kanada who first propounded that the anu was an
indestructible particle of matter. He also discovered that the density of molecules
is peculiar to each matter and so an object weighs less in water than in air, even
earlier to Archimedes. Kanada has also described the dimension and motion of
atoms and their chemical reactions with each other. Find out more about
Acharya Kanada’s life and work.

5] In the Laboratory—Experimental Project/Making a Model
0 To study density of solutions You know that a substance that is denser than water will sink
in it. A substance that is less dense than water will float on it. When we dissolve a solid in water,
does the density of water increase, decrease or remain the same? Let us find out through
an experiment.

You will need ¢ a beaker half-filled with water ¢ a teaspoon ¢ salt an egg

Procedure:

¢ Place the egg in the beaker half-
filled with water. If the egg is
spoilt, it will float on water. In this
case, select another egg which sinks
in water. Is the density of the egg
more or less than that of water?

¢ Take the egg out of water. Now add
two teaspoonfuls of salt to water.
Stir until the salt dissolves. Place
the egg in the solution. Does it
float or sink?

¢ If it sinks, add some more salt to the solution. Stir it thoroughly. Now place the egg again in
solution. Keep doing this until the egg floats on it.

What can you say about the density of the solution now?

Is it more or less than that of the egg?

Does the density of water increase or decrease when you add salt to it?

How can you use this experiment to find out which liquids are denser than water?

MIXTURES AND PURE SUBSTANCES
Nimbu-pani (lemonade) is a mixture of lemon
juice, sugar and water. All these are compounds.
Like lemonade, most substances around us are
mixtures of two or more elements or compounds.

~ Tap water is a mixture—it contains water
and many dissolved salts.

<+ Sea water is a mixture—it has several salts
dissolved in water. In fact, the common salt we
use in our food comes mostly from sea water.

<> Milk is a mixture. It contains water, cream
and other things.

cellulose and water.

of Substances

carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, etc.

Dust and smoke particles are also present in air.

Thus, mixtures contain molecules of two or
more substances. If a substance contains only
one type of atoms or molecules, it is called a pure
substance. Very few pure substances are found in
nature. Sugar or salt crystals are pure substances.
So are the chemicals found in a laboratory. All
elements and compounds are pure substances.

Types of mixtures

The different substances present in a mixture
are called its components or constituents.
Sometimes the constituents are uniformly spread
over the mixture and each part of the mixture

has the same properties. Such a mixture is called
a homogeneous mixture. If you dissolve sugar
in water, the molecules of sugar and water are
evenly spread, forming a homogeneous mixture.
No matter which part of the mixture you take,
it will have the same properties. Air is also a
homogeneous mixture.

In some mixtures, the constituents are
not evenly spread throughout the mixture and
each part of the mixture does not have the
same properties. Such a mixture is called a
heterogeneous mixture. For example, if you
mix iron filings and sand, it will have more iron
filings at some places and less at other places.
The iron and sand molecules will not be evenly
spread in the mixture. Therefore different parts
of the mixture will exhibit different properties.
A mixture of chalk in water and dusty air are
also heterogeneous mixtures.

Properties of mixtures

~ The constituents of a mixture may be in
any ratio.

They retain their individual properties. This is
because the molecules of the constituents do not
change. For example, the properties of iron and
sulphur do not change when mixed together.

< The constituents can be separated by simple
methods. For example, you can clearly see
tiny stones in rice and easily separate them.
But can you tell by looking at a glass of water,

whether it has dissolved substances in it? For
this, you will have to study some properties of the

sample of water given to you and compare them
with the properties of pure water. Melting point
and boiling point are two such properties.

A pure compound has fixed melting and
boiling points. Pure water at sea level boils
at 100°C. However, if there are dissolved
substances in the water, its boiling point goes
up. Thus, by measuring the boiling point you
will know whether the water is pure or not.

WHY IS SEPARATION NECESSARY?
Separation of mixtures into their constituents
is often necessary for several reasons. These are
as follows.

To remove undesirable constituents

Small stones present in rice can be harmful for
our teeth and body. It is necessary to remove
them before cooking the rice. Tea leaves are
separated from tea by using a strainer. If you
are not fond of chillies, you separate them from
vegetables before eating.

Sometimes, harmful substances are present
in river water. They must be removed before
supplying the water to our homes. This is done
at the waterworks in the towns and cities, anc
by water filters used at home.

Air contains many substances, such as gases
smoke and dust particles. Our body requires onl
oxygen for respiration. It separates the oxyger
and breathes out the other components. Yo
may have seen persons who are very ill bein
put on a respirator which supplies oxygen t
the patient. Here, the process of separating th
unwanted components is already done so tha
the body does not have to do it.

To obtain useful constituents

Butter can be obtained from milk or curd by chumin
it. Crude oil or petroleum is a mixture of several usefi
constituents. Petrol, kerosene, diesel, tar, etc. a
obtained by separating them from crude oil.

To obtain pure substances
Sometimes substances in their pure form are
needed for use at home, or for research work

and other purposes. For this, even minute
amounts of other substances present have to
be separated.

ORAL QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

1. If a substance contains two or more kinds of molecules, what is it called?

2. Are most substances around us pure substances or mixtures?

3. Samples were taken from different parts of a mixture and tested. They were found to have exactly

the same properties. What kind of mixture is it?

4. If a compound has fixed melting and boiling points, what can you say about the compound?

5. Why do we need to separate mixtures into its constituents?

METHODS OF SEPARATION
To separate a mixture, we have to use such a
property that one constituent of the mixture
has and the others do not. For example, to
separate iron filings from sulphur, we can use
the property that iron is attracted by a magnet
but sulphur is not.

Separating solids from other solids

The properties commonly used to separate
solids from a mixture of solids are—colour,
size, shape, weight, attraction by magnet, or
solubility in a liquid such as water. Let us read
about some methods of separation.
Threshing and winnowing: After the wheat
or rice crop is harvested, the grains have to

Fic. 5.2 Separating chaff from grain by winnowing

be separated. The first step is to separate
the grains from the stalks. This is known as
threshing. It is done either by beating the
stalks on the ground or a hard surface, by
trampling the harvested wheat or rice using
animals, or by using a mechanical thresher.
The grains are then separated, from the
mixture of grain and chaff so obtained, by using
the property that grain is heavier than chaff. The
mixture is allowed to fall from a height. The
breeze blows away the chaff, while the grain falls
down almost vertically (Fig. 5.2). The chaff forms
a heap at a little distance away from the heap
of grain. This process is known as winnowing.
Hand-picking: Undesirable substances such as

pieces of stones in rice or dal can be separated

Fic. 5.3 Removing stones from rice by hand-picking

SEPARATION OF SUBSTANCES @ 49


Page nummber: 50
by hand-picking. This is possible because the
particles of the undesirable substance are
different from the foodgrains in colour, shape
and size. This method is convenient when the
undesirable components are present in small
quantities.

Sieving: When the constituents of a mixture
have particles of different sizes, a sieve can be
used to separate them. The size of the pores in
the sieve depends on the size of the particles
of the constituent to be separated.

A sieve with fine pores is used to separate
undesirable substances in flour. A sieve with
bigger pores is used at construction sites to
separate stones from sand (Fig. 5.4).

A sieve is often used at home to separate
the bigger particles in wheat flour (atta).
However, this is not considered a healthy
practice nowadays, as the bigger particles of

For this we need a fine filter. A filter paper can
be used for this purpose.

The filter paper has fine holes which
allow water to flow through, but not the mud
particles. (See Activity 2)

At homes and in offices or schools, special
types of filters are used to remove solid
impunties from drinking water. In these filters,
a porous pot made of ceramic is used as a filter.
As the water passes through the fine pores, the
solid impunties are filtered out. In some of these
filters, a special type of light called ultraviolet
light is used to kill germs in the water.
Loading: If the suspended particles of a solid
in a liquid are very fine, they take a very long
time to settle down. For example, the particles
of clay in muddy water are very fine, and their

Activity 3 (Research)
A method of cleaning water for drinking,
which is gaining popularity today, is reverse
osmosis (RO). Water is passed through a
special membrane called a semi-permeable
membrane. It has very fine pores through
which water can pass through but not the
impurities. Find out about the different kinds
of RO water filters available in the market and
their prices.

sedimentation takes a very long time. Loading
is a method of speeding up sedimentation
by making the particles heavier. Alum, a solid
which is soluble in water, is used to load
suspended clay particles in water (Fig. 5.7).
The dissolved particles of alum load the fine
particles of clay in water. They become heavier

Activity 2 (Experimental investigation):
To separate a mixture of mud and water by filtration
Take some muddy water in a beaker. Take a circular piece of filter paper and fold it twice as shown
in Fig. 5.6a. Open it out to make a cone. Place the filter paper cone in a funnel. Keep a beaker
below the funnel. Pour the muddy water slowly into the cone, using a glass rod (Fig. 5.6b).
Clear water flows down the funnel and collects in the beaker below. Take out the filter paper cone

and open it out. Mud particles are seen on the paper.

Application of methods of separation—
obtaining drinking water
Tap water supplied to our homes is first cleaned
in the waterworks (Fig. 5.8). The processes used
are as follows:
< Sedimentation and decantation is first done
to remove larger particles of solid impuntties.

the smaller particles by loading.
< The water is then filtered by passing it

To get back the water that evaporates,

hold a cool steel plate above the

it condenses to form liquid water. You can see

drops of water on the plate. The process of

Sea water contains a lot of salt. The salt

that we use in our food is mostly obtained by
evaporating sea water. Sea water is collected in
shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate in the
sun. Salt is left behind.
Distillation: Distillation is a method of
obtaining pure liquid from a solution. The
solution is heated so that the liquid evaporates.
The vapours are then cooled. They condense to
give the pure liquid.

Distilled water used in laboratories is
obtained in this way. A special apparatus
(Fig. 5.10) is used to get distilled water.
Water containing dissolved impurities is kept
in a flask. An apparatus, called the Liebig’s
condenser, is fitted to the flask to cool the
water vapour. Cold water is made to flow
through the condenser.

As the water in the flask is heated, it
evaporates. The water vapour cools and
condenses in the Liebig’s condenser. The drops
of distilled water formed are collected in
another flask.

Separating liquids

immiscible with each other. If you vigorously

Fractional distillation: Two miscible liquids
that have different boiling points, for example
water and alcohol, can be separated by a
process called fractional distillation.

The mixture of water and alcohol is heated

Water can dissolve a large number of
Substances in it. It is, therefore, called the
universal solvent.

Some substances such as wood or sand do
not dissolve in water. Others, such as sugar or
salt, dissolve readily in water.

Substances that dissolve readily in water are
said to be soluble in water. Substances such as
sand, that do not dissolve in water, are said to
be insoluble in water.

During the formation of a solution, the
molecules of the solute or solvent remain
the same. It is easy to get back both in their
original forms from the solution. You have
already seen that salt can be obtained from
a solution of salt and water by heating
till the water evaporates. The water can be
obtained by condensing the water vapour
formed.

Acivir 7 (Experimental investigation):
To make a saturated solution
Add some sugar to water taken in a test tube
and stir. The sugar dissolves. Add more and
more sugar until no more sugar dissolves, no
matter how much you stir. You now have a
saturated solution of sugar in water. How
many spoons of sugar will dissolve in a glass
of water?

Heat the test tube: Does more sugar n now

dissolve in the water?

Try with salt. How many spoons of salt
will dissolve in a glass of water? Does more
Salt dissolve in water after heating the
_ water?

Try with other substances that are soluble
in water.

You will observe from this activity that:

+ Different quantities of different substances
can dissolve in a fixed quantity of water. We
say that different substances have different
solubility in water.

“ The solubility of sugar in water increases
with an increase in temperature. The
solubility of most other substances in water
also increases with temperature. However,
the solubility of salt increases very little
with temperature.

IMPORTANCE OF WATER

AS A SOLVENT
It is because of its property of dissolving a
large number of substances that water is so
essential for life. Our body cannot absorb food
substances unless they are soluble in water.
In the process of digestion, food is reduced to
simple substances that are soluble in water.
They can then be dissolved in water and
absorbed by the body. Several waste matenals
produced in the body are dissolved in water and
excreted. A number of chemical reactions occur
inside our body. They all occur in the presence
of water.

Plants can absorb nutrients from the
soil only if they are soluble in water. Minerals
from the roots and food from the leaves
are transported to different parts of the plant
in the form of solutions in water.

Gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide
which are soluble in water are important for
survival of aquatic life. Fish breathe in the
oxygen dissolved in water through their gills.
Aquatic plants use the carbon dioxide dissolved
in water for photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is
dissolved in aerated drinks to give them their
tangy taste.

The solubility of gases in water decreases
with ‘increase in temperature. Thus,
dissolved gases escape from water when it
is heated. This can easily be seen by gently
heating water in a pot. You will see small
bubbles coming out, much before water starts
boiling. These are bubbles of air dissolved in
water.

OUR HERITAGE
The salt we use at home is mainly obtained by separating it from sea water. This Sepalation
acquired a historical place in India’s struggle for independence from the British. In British” 4
India, Indians were prohibited from producing and selling salt. They had to use salt a
supplied by the British. Gandhiji decided to protest against this unfair law. He undertook ‘the
Dandi March from his ashram in Sabarmati to the town of Dandi on the coast of the Arabian hn
Sea. He was joined by thousands of people. On 6 April 1930, Gandhiji and his followers broke
the Salt Law by picking up handfuls of natural salt from the shore.

The Dandi March was an important step in the non-violent satyagraha movement against

British rule in India.

Separating a mixture into its constituents is important for—removing undesirable constitu-
ents, obtaining a useful constituent and obtaining substances in their pure form.

To separate a constituent from a mixture we use some properties that one constituent of the
mixture has and the other constituents do not.

Solids can be separated from other solids by winnowing, hand-picking and sieving.

Insoluble solids can be separated from liquids by sedimentation and decantation, filtration or
by loading.

Loading is used to speed up sedimentation of fine solid particles in a liquid.

Soluble solids can be separated from liquids by evaporation.

A pure liquid can be obtained from its solution by distillation.

Immiscible liquids can be separated by a separating funnel.

Miscible liquids with different boiling points can be separated by fractional distillation.

A solution is formed when a solute dissolves in a solvent.

Solubility of most substances increases with an increase in temperature.

In a factory, holes need to be drilled in steel to manufacture car parts. While doing this,

the drill and steel get very hot due to friction and this can damage both. To solve this
problem, a mixture of oil and water is sprayed onto the drill bit. The mixture acts as both a
coolant and a lubricant. At the end of the process, there is a waste mixture of fine steel bits,
dirty oil and water. To avoid wastage and pollution, it is advisable to separate the waste mixture
and reuse the components. ee

small that they cannot be seen and the solution remains clear. Add some mud to a beaker of water
and stir it. Let it stand for some time. After the bigger insoluble particles settle down, the water still
appears muddy. This is because small particles of mud remain suspended in water and do not settle
down. Such a mixture is called a suspension. Its particles are bigger than that of a solution. Now

Francis Aston (1877-1945) invented a machine that separates the atoms in a
mixture according to their mass. The machine shows the amounts of the different
atoms that are present in the sample. The machine uses a powerful magnet for this
separation and also works on substances that are not attracted by a magnet.
The machine is known as a mass spectrometer. This invention won Aston the

Changes Around Us

Most of the things around us are changing all
the time. Some common changes we observe are:
¢ changes in weather ¢ alternation of day and
night « cooking of food + spoilage of food
if kept for longerusting of iron « burning
of paper, wood and fuels « changes in plants—
germination of seeds, growth, flowering,
formation of fruits « changes in animals—
growth, producing babies * movement of
things—sometimes slow, sometimes fast,
sometimes a repeated motion such as that of
a pendulum.

Do you know why these changes occur?
Changes in weather occur due to the heat of
the sun. Day and night alternate because of the

rotation of the earth. In the same way every
change has a cause. These causes can bring
about changes in:

“: SHAPE You can change the shape of a
balloon by squeezing it; if you squeeze hard
enough it will burst.

~ SIZE A blown-up balloon increases in size

Fic. 6.1 Changing the shape of a balloon by squeezing

the structure of the molecules that make
up food changes; burning wax brings about
changes in the molecules of wax. In both
these cases, new substances are formed.

‘Acivmy 1 (Observation and inference)
Make a list of some changes occurring around
you and their causes.

REVERSIBLE AND
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES
Consider the changes listed above.
» The shape of the balloon comes back to its
original when you stop squeezing it.
The balloon returns to its previous size when
kept out of the sun for a little while.
The kicked football can be brought back to
its original position.
* The red hot piece of iron regains its original
colour when it is cooled.
+ The molten wax becomes solid again when
cooled.
All these changes can therefore be easily
reversed. They are known as reversible changes.

o
“

ae

a

ie a. Kicking a football

In most reversible changes, the internal structure
of the substances involved does not change. The
molecules that make up the substance do not
change.

Now consider the other changes.

+ Bursting of a balloon cannot be reversed.

+ Growth is a change that cannot be reversed.

* Cooking of food or burning of wax cannot
be reversed.

These are irreversible changes. In most
irreversible changes there is a change in the
internal structure. The molecules that make up
the substances undergo changes to form new
substances during growth, cooking or burning.
However, in some irreversible changes the internal
structure of the substances does not change.
For example, when a balloon bursts, there is no ~
change in the molecules of the rubber.

One way to group changes is to see if they
are reversible or irreversible.

Let us now study changes based on the
changes in the internal structure of the
substances involved.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES
One of the most important methods of
classifying changes depends on whether new
substances are formed during the change or
not. Let us consider some examples.

Kicking a football: When you kick a football
(Fig. 6.2a), its position changes but it
remains a football. No new substance is formed:

b. Freezing of water

Fic. 6.2 Some physical changes

62 @ MATERIALS


Page nummber: 63
The molecules that make up the football remain
the same.

Tearing of paper: On tearing, a paper changes
its shape and size but it remains a paper. No
new substance is formed. The molecules of
paper remain the same.

Changing of size with use: The size of a
pencil or eraser changes with use, but no new
substance is formed. The molecules that make
up the pencil and eraser remain the same.
Freezing of water: You can easily get ice by
freezing water (Fig. 6.2b). The molecules of ice
and water are exactly the same.

Heating substances: If a balloon is kept in
the sun, its size increases because the air in it
expands on heating. This is called expansion.
When a piece of iron is heated, it expands.
Similarly liquids expand on heating. If the
heated substances are cooled, they regain their
original size. The molecules of the substance do
not change.

In all these changes, no new substances are
formed. The molecules of the substance remain
exactly the same before and after the change.
Such changes are called physical changes.

Some physical changes such as tearing of
paper or changing of size of a pencil with use
cannot be reversed. However, most physical
changes are temporary and can be easily
reversed to return substances to their previous
form. Most physical changes are reversible.

Let us now consider some more changes.

a. Burning of paper

FITTING AN IRON RIM ON
A WOODEN WHEEL

Expansion on heating is used to fit an iron
fim to a wooden wheel. The rim is made
slightly smaller in diameter than the wheel.
It is heated so that it expands. The hot nm is
then slipped ‘on to the wheel. Gold water is
poured on. it to cool it. The nm contracts on
cooling and firmly gnps the wheel.

Burning: When you burn a piece of paper,
smoke and gases like carbon dioxide and
water vapour are given out. The ash left
behind differs from paper in its appearance and
properties. Thus, new substances with different
properties and different molecules are formed
(Fig. 6.3a).

Similarly when you burn a matchstick or
a candle, new substances are formed. Do you
think burning is a reversible change?
Growth in plants and animals: What happens
to the food you eat? It is absorbed by the body
and is used to nounsh cells for growth. The
substances that make up a cell are different

b. Cooking of rotis

Fic. 6.3 Some chemical changes

CHANGES AROUND US @ 63


Page nummber: 64
from the substances present in food. Again, new
substances are formed.

Cooking: When you boil an egg, it becomes
hard and tastes very different. The molecules
change to give new substances. Similarly
cooking of rotis (Fig. 6.3b), vegetables or rice
results in new substances being formed.

In all the above examples, new substances
with different properties are formed. The
molecules of the original substances undergo
changes to form molecules of new substances.
Such changes are called chemical changes.

A chemical change occurs when there is a
chemical reaction between the substances. In a
chemical reaction, the initial substances react with
each other to form new substances. The original
substances present are known as reactants.
The new substances formed during or after the
chemical reaction are known as products.

Since new substances with different
molecules are formed during chemical reactions,
it is not easy to get back the original substances.
Most chemical changes are, therefore, permanent
and irreversible.

Differences between physical and chemical
changes are discussed in Table 6.1.

CHANGES WHEN DIFFERENT
SUBSTANCES ARE MIXED
So far we have seen the kind of changes that
occur in an object or the material it is made
of. Let us see what kind of changes occur when
different substances are mixed together.

You have seen that when salt: is mixed
with water it dissolves, forming a solution.
You also saw that we can get back the salt
by evaporation of water and the water by
condensation of the water vapour. Thus the
change is reversible. The molecules of water
or salt do not undergo any change. Therefore
dissolving salt in water is a physical change. -

soda and lemon juice Meee

CHEMICAL CHANGES

New substances with different properties
are formed. The molecules of the substances

undergo changes to form molecules of new
substances.

Chemical changes are permanent and cannot
easily be reversed.


Page nummber: 65
IT’S A FACT!

Some chemical changes require the }
presence of another substance which itself
does not undergo any change. Such a substance _
is called a catalyst. Chlorophyll in plants isa
catalyst. It changes water and carbon dioxide
in presence of sunlight to food (glucose)
but itself does not get changed.

A chemical reaction has taken place between
the reactants, washing soda and lemon juice.
Carbon dioxide is one of the products. Other
products are also formed. The chemical change
cannot be reversed to get back the reactants
from the products. The chemical reaction can
be written as follows:

other

_, carbon
products

dioxide

washing lemon
soda juice

We thus see that when substances are mixed,
it can result in a physical or a chemical change.
This depends on the substances that are mixed
and also on the conditions. For example, if iron
and sulphur are mixed, no chemical change
occurs. But when the mixture is heated, it glows
after some time and a black substance is formed.
The black substance is a different compound
with entirely different properties from those
of iron and sulphur. So heating a mixture of
iron and sulphur results in a chemical change.
Cooking of food is another example of chemical
change occurring on heating.

Chemical changes can also occur under
other conditions—for example, when solutions

IT’S A FACT!
Most chemical reactions need a certain amount
of energy to start. A matchstick starts burning
only when sufficient heat energy is supplied to
it by striking it. A candle starts burning only
when heat energy is supplied to it by the burning
matchstick. The energy required to start a chemical |
reaction is known as its activation energy.

of solids are mixed or when electricity is passed
through a mixture.

SOME MORE EXAMPLES OF PHYSICAL
AND CHEMICAL CHANGES

The details of some changes are given below.
Apply your knowledge of physical and chemical
changes to classify the changes as physical or
chemical.

Boiling, evaporation and condensation: The
molecules of a liquid start moving faster when
the liquid is heated. They start escaping from
the liquid as gas. But when the gas is cooled,
we get the liquid back in its onginal form. Are
boiling, evaporation and condensation physical
or chemical changes? Are they reversible or
irreversible?

Activity 3 (Experimental investigation):
Warm some milk in a cup. Put a teaspoonful
of curd in it. Cover it and leave it overnight
without disturbing it. What do you see next
morning? Has the milk changed completely to
curd? Do you think this change is reversible?
Do you think the molecules in milk have
undergone a change?

Setting of milk to form curd is a chemical
change. It is irreversible.

Rusting: When an iron chain is kept in humid
air for some days, a brown substance deposits
on it. This slowly eats up or corrodes the iron.
It is found that the brown substance called rust
has very different properties from those of iron.

Fic. 6.5 Rusting of iron

CHANGES AROUND US @ 65

Acuvity 4 (Observation and inference): To classify and study some changes

+ growth of a plan

"+ boiling’ of an egg rotation of a fan * grinding grain to get flour . ‘
Among the changes listed above, is there any irreversible physical change? Is weathering of rocks —
a physical change or a chemical change? Can you give more examp

»are irreversible?

There is no simple way to get back the iron from
rust. What do you think rusting is—a physical
change or a chemical change; reversible or
irreversible?

Melting of a solid: You have seen earlier
that freezing of water is a physical change.
What kind of change do you think is melting—
physical or chemical, reversible or irreversible?
Burning of a candle: What do you observe
when a candle is burnt? Heat and light are
given off, the wax melts and drips, and the
candle becomes shorter. We have already seen
that burning is a chemical change in which
heat and light are given off. But it is not

les of physical changes which

solid or liquid wax that burns—it is actually
wax vapour that burns. The heat of the flame
melts the wax. This is a physical change of wax.
The liquid wax creeps up the wick by what is
known as capillary action. The heat from the
flame vaporizes the liquid wax. This is also
a physical change. But when the wax vapour
burns, it is a chemical change. The heat of the
flame keeps melting the wax, thus shortening
the candle. Some wax drips down and solidifies
again on cooling. This solidification is also a
physical change.

Thus, wax undergoes both chemical and
physical changes when a candle burns.

by a magnet? What do you think rusting is—a physical change or a chemical change? Iron rusts when
exposed to air. You know that air contains mainly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour and carbon dioxide.
Let us see which of these are required for rusting.
You will need ¢ unrusted iron nails ¢ vaseline ¢ four bell jars (or wide-mouthed bottles) ¢ candle
¢ water ¢ potassium hydroxide solution ¢ calcium chloride
Procedure: ;
¢ Make four heaps (A, B, C and D) of
4-5 unrusted iron nails each. Sprinkle
a few drops of water over heaps A, B, C
and D to increase water vapour. Cover
~ heap A with a bell jar.
= ° Keep potassium hydroxide solution in
~ ‘an evaporating dish near heap B. Cover POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE CALCIUM CHLORIDE
with a bell jar.
The potassium hydroxide solution will absorb all the carbon dioxide from the air in the bell jar.
¢ Near heap C, keep calcium chloride in an evaporating dish and cover with a bell jar. Calcium
chloride will absorb all the water vapour from the air in the bell jar.
¢ Near heap D, fix a candle. Light it, and cover with the fourth bell jar. The candle will be
extinguished after some time. The air in the bell jar will not contain oxygen now.

¢ Seal allthe bell jars using vaseline. It is very important to seal the bell jars properly so. that air from
outside cannot enter inside.

¢ Observe the nails for a week. In which heap of sai has rusting taken place? Note your
observations in the table below. Can you now say what is necessary for rusting to take place?

Living and Non-living

LIVING AND NON-LIVING
Many things that we see around us every day
are living or were once alive. But what does it
mean to be living? All the animals and plants
that you see around you are living. Other

2 IT’S'‘A. FACT!
AS eatly as about 200 years ago, many people
_ thought that living things could suddenly
develop from non-living, things. They thought,
for example, that maggots developed from
decaying meat, The experiments of the Italian
Scientist Lazzaro Spallanzanl in the 18th
century, and Louis Pasteur in the 19th century
proved that this was not correct.

objects that you notice every day, such as
cars, rocks, bricks, buckets, bottles, etc. are
non-living.

Things such-as furniture, cricket. bats,
hockey sticks and corks are made up of wood.
You can call them dead things, though the trees
from which the wood was taken to make these
things were once living.

Common features of living and non-living things
All living and non-living things are made
up of matter. You have already read that
matter occupies space and has mass. Thus, all
living and non-living things have mass and
occupy space.

IN THIS CHAPTER

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIVING AND NON-LIVING THINGS @ CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING THINGS @ SPECIES

LIVING AND NON-LIVING @ 71


Page nummber: 72
Another common feature between living and
non-living things is that they are made up of
structural units. A non-living thing like a chalk
can be broken into smaller and smaller particles
until you get the smallest piece of chalk. You
have read that a molecule is the smallest unit
of matter. So a molecule is the structural unit of
chalk. Thus, molecules are the structural units
of non-living things. The structural unit of a
living thing is the cell. Cells vary in size and
shape. There are different kinds of cells in the
body of a living thing. Cells can be seen under

Fic. 7-1 Cells in an onion peel

a microscope. Figure 7.1 shows cells in an onion
peel as seen under a microscope.

Differences between living and non-living things
Do this simple activity.

Activity 1 (Observation and inference)
Observe a living thing like a dog, and
compare it to a non-living thing such as a
stone. What differences can you list?

You will be able to observe some differences
such as movement, intake of food, excretion
and respiration quite easily. We normally
recognize a living thing by its activities such as
walking or running. But a robot can also walk,
and a car can run. Will you call a robot or a car
a living thing?

All living things have some common
characteristics that are not present in non-
living things. Let us study some of the features
of living things—both animals and plants.

ORAL QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

1. Name some features that are common to both living and non-living things.

2. What is the difference between the structural units of living things and those of non-living things?

CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING THINGS
Several living things move

You can see animals moving. They move around
in search of food or shelter, or to escape from
enemies. Besides, their body parts move in
different ways.

Plants do not move around in search of
food and shelter. However, you can observe
movement in a plant when you touch the
leaves of the Mimosa or touch-me-not (chhui-
mul) plant, or in sunflower as it turns to face
the sun. Similar kinds of movement are also
visible in the leaves of orchid tree (kachnar)
and flowers of lotus and water lily.

As you have seen, some non-living things

can move too. But they do not have the other
characteristics present in living things.

All living things are made up of cells

Your school building is made up of bricks
arranged in layers. A brick is the smallest unit
of construction. Similarly living organisms
are made up of tiny units called cells. Some
plants and animals consist of only one cell. All
bacteria, yeast (a fungus) and some plants living
in water are one-celled (unicellular). Amoebe.
Paramecium and many other animals are also
made up of only a single cell. There is no change
in the number of cells throughout their Life
cycle. The bigger the animal, the greater the

72 @ THE WORLD OF THE LIVING


Page nummber: 73
number of cells that make up its body. But they
also begin their life from a single cell.

Living things grow

Acuvry 2 (Experimental investigation)
Repeat Activity 3 of Chapter 1. But this time
keep the soaked seeds in dark. You can keep
the seeds in a cupboard where no light comes
in. What do you observe after a few days?

Living things usually do not remain the
same size. You have increased in size as you
have grown older (Fig. 7.2a). A small puppy
grows into a dog. Small seedlings grow into
plants (Fig. 7.2b). Many of them grow to
become tall trees.

b. Growth in a seedling c. Growing crystals

Fic. -7.2

The growth of living things is different
from the growth of non-living things such as
a crystal (Fig. 7.2c) or a heap of sand. Growth
in living things occurs within the organism by
the division of cells. In single-celled organisms,

growth occurs only in the size of the cell.
In non-living things, growth occurs due to
addition of material from the outside.
Animals stop growing after they have
reached a certain size and age, whereas plants
continue to grow throughout their life.

Living things have a definite lifespan

Each living organism is born, it grows and then
dies. Different organisms have different lifespan
(Table 7.1).

Taste 7.1 Average lifespan of some organisms

ORGANISM AVERAGE LIFESPAN
bacteria 20 minutes
housefly 1-4 months
mouse 2-3 years
squirrel 8-9 years
dog 12-14 years
lobster 20 years
lion 20-25 years
| horse 25-30 years
ostrich 45-50 years
human being 60-80 years
elephant 70-90 years
tortoise 120-150 years
bristlecone pine | thousands of years me

Living things reproduce

All living organisms reproduce their own
kind (Fig. 7.3). All animals such as human
beings, dogs, cats or cows give birth to new
animals like themselves. We all know that baby
birds hatch from eggs. The bird sits.on the eggs

Fic. 7.3 Living things reproduce.

LIVING AND NON-LIVING @ 73


Page nummber: 74
Fic. 7.4 Hatching of an egg

to keep them warm. Baby birds come out of the
eggs after a few days (Fig. 7.4). Frogs, snakes,
spiders and mosquitoes also hatch from eggs.
Most plants are produced from seeds.

Can you imagine what would happen if
living things could not reproduce? There would
be no living organism on the earth.

Living things respond to stimulus
What happens when you accidentally touch a
hot utensil? You quickly withdraw your hand.
The withdrawing of your hand is a response.
The cause of this response is called the
stimulus which in this case is the hot utensil.
Why do the leaves of the Mimosa plant
(or touch-me-not as it is commonly called)
droop if something touches it? Touch is the
stimulus to which the sensitive plant responds
by folding its leaves (Fig. 7.5).

b. After being touched
Fic. 7.5 Leaves of Mimosa plant

a. Before being touched

a. Response of a plant

b. Response of a plant
towards gravity

Fic. 7.6

Keep a small potted plant near a window
through which light can come in. After a few
days you will notice that the tip of the plant
bends towards the direction from where the
light is coming in (Fig. 7.6a). This response
of a plant to light is known as phototropism.
On the other hand, animals like cockroach and
earthworm move away from light.

Roots have a tendency to grow towards
the earth and stems tend to grow against
it. The response of roots and stems towards
and against the earth is called geotropism
(Fig. 7.6b).

All living organisms show response to stimuli
such as temperature, touch, light and sound.

Living things need food

How do you feel when you do not get food
on time? All living organisms need food. Food
gives them energy to grow, to move and for
other life processes that go on inside their
bodies. Green plants make their own food in
their green leaves. They are called autotrophs
as they make their food themselves. They do
not move about like animals in search of food.
Many wild animals get their food by killing
other animals. Others eat only plants. Animals
are heterotrophs as they depend on others for
their food.

74 @ THE WORLD OF THE LIVING


Page nummber: 75
Living things excrete a
There are several processes going. on inside
our body, such as digestion, respiration, etc.
During these processes some waste products are
produced. These are removed from our body in
the form of urine, sweat and exhaled air (when
we breathe out).

Similarly, plants also excrete water vapour
and carbon dioxide from small pores called
stomata present in their leaves and stem
(Fig. 7.7). Besides, some harmful substances
are produced in plants as wastes. Some plants
remove these waste products as secretions.
Others are able to store waste products in such
a way that they do not harm the plant.

Living things respire

Take a deep breath. The air you breathe in
passes into your lungs. Here the oxygen in the
air is absorbed and used by the body. Carbon
dioxide is produced as waste. When you breathe
out, this carbon dioxide is expelled from your
body, along with the unused air. This process
js known as respiration. Breathing in and out
is a part of respiration.

The oxygen breathed in combines with
the food that you digest and produces energy.
Why do we need energy? We need energy
to stay alive. The movement of your arms
and legs, the blinking of your eyes and the
beating of your heart uses energy. You use
energy when you read a book, when you think
and when you eat. Oxygen is the primary need
of all organisms. Living organisms respire all
the time.

All land animals breathe in oxygen from the
air. Animals like cows, dogs and birds breathe
like us. The earthworm breathes through its
skin. The cockroach breathes through several
holes in its body. Fish breathe the oxygen
dissolved in water through their gills.

In plants, the process of exchange of

Fic. 7.7 A stomata

gases takes place through the tiny stomata in
their leaves. You know that plants take
in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis during
the day and give out oxygen. Respiration
in’ plants takes place day and night. During
the day, the amount of oxygen given out
by them during photosynthesis is more
than the amount of oxygen used up in
respiration. So, during the day, plants supply
oxygen to air.

SPECIES

You come across various kinds of organisms
in your surroundings. Are they all alike?
Certainly not. A dog differs from a cat, a cat
from a pig and a pig from a goat. Each kind
of organism (dog, cat, pig and goat) has
many individuals which are similar to
each other. These individuals may differ
slightly but their form, habit and behaviour
are.almost the same. Such a group of
similar living organisms‘is known as a species.
The members of a species have similar
body parts, live in the same habitat, eat
the same kind of food and reproduce among
themselves. A ‘horse will always produce horses.
It cannot produce an elephant. A rose plant
will always produce seeds from which only rose
plants can grow.

There are about 16,00,000 species of animals
and 4,00,000 species of plants in the world.

HERBS, SHRUBS AND TREES
Plants grow all around us. They grow on land
as well as in water. It has been estimated that
there are about 2,50,000 types of plants. To
make the study of plants easier, they have been
divided into groups. The two broad groups are
flowering plants and non-flowering plants.
These are further divided into many subgroups.

Plants like rose, sunflower and mango are
flowering plants. Plants like ferns and mosses
do not bear flowers. They are non-flowering
plants.

Another way of classifying plants is
according to their size and the nature of their
stem. Based on this, plants can be classified

into three categones—herbs, & ee

shrubs and trees. Table 8.1 m@gmmaee

PLANT SYSTEMS
Various parts of a plant perform different QS
functions to keep it alive. Let us study the parts a WANG
of a flowering plant.

ACTIVITY 1 (Experimental investigation) |
Dig out a small plant, say, a mustard plant
-and examine it carefully. What do you observe?

STEM

You will notice that the plant has two parts:

* The underground part of the plant or the
part that remains in the soil is called the
root system. It consists of a main root and MAIN ROOT Sas =
a number of branching roots. ;

+ The green part that grows above the ground
is called the shoot system. It consists of
the stem, leaves, buds, flowers and fruits
(Fig. 8.2).

FIG. 8.2 Most flowering plants have two
main systems—root system and the shoot system.

b. Fibrous root

a. Tap root
FIG. 8.3 Types of root system

are called lateral roots. Pea, holy basil (tulsi),
radish, carrot and turnip are examples of some
other plants that have tap roots.

In a grass plant, a number of thin fibre-like
roots arise from the base of the stem. They
spread out in the soil and give support to
the plant. These are known as fibrous roots
(Fig. 8.3b). Maize, wheat and barley are examples
of some other plants that have fibrous roots.

Thus, the two types of root system are

~ the tap root system, and
+ the fibrous root system.

Functions of the root

«+ If you try to pull out a plant from the
ground, it will not come out easily. What
fixes the plant firmly in the ground? The
roots. The roots are said to anchor the plant
to the soil.

+ Can a plant survive if you cut all its roots and
fix it to the ground? Definitely not! It will
dry up after some time. This is because roots

absorb water and minerals present in the
soil. Water and mineral salts reach the stem
and the branches, through a system of thin
tubes present in the roots and the stem.

+ Roots also bind the soil particles together
and thus prevent soil erosion.

Modifications of the root

In some plants, roots perform other functions
too besides the three primary functions
mentioned above. For this, their structure is
slightly changed. These changes are known as
modifications.

Roots are modified to store food: We eat radish,
carrot and turnip because there is food stored
in them (Fig. 8.4). Which
part of the plants are
these? These are roots.
The food made in the
green leaves travels
downwards and is stored
in these tap roots.
Plants use this food
when conditions are not
favourable.

Roots are modified to give extra support:
The banyan tree has roots that grow down from
its branches. As these roots reach the ground,
they fix themselves in the soil and give support
to the spreading branches of the huge tree
(Fig 8.5a). Such roots are called prop roots.
They support the tree just as pillars support a

IT’S A FACT!
The big banyan tree in the Indian Botanical a
Garden near Kolkata has more than 900 prop roots.
They support the huge canopy of branches. 3

Observe such roots in sugarcane, screw pine
(kewra) and maize (Fig. 8.5b). They provide
extra support to the thin stem and help it to

5. What is the function of the roots in 4c above?

THE STEM
Functions of the stem

+ The stem keeps the plant upright.

* The stem bears branches, leaves, flowers and
fruits. Leaves are arranged in such a way
that they are exposed to plenty of sunlight.

* The stem transports (or conducts) water,
minerals and food to all parts of the plant.
A set of thin tubes from the roots are
connected to thin tubes in the stem. Water
and minerals pass through these tubes to
leaves, flowers, buds and fruits. The food
made by leaves passes to other parts of the
plant through another set of thin tubes.
Activity 4 shows that there are thin tubes

present in the stem through which water is

ACTIVITY 4 (Experimental investigation):
To study transport of water through the stem
Cut a balsam plant at the base. Place it in a beaker half-filled with water:
(Fig. 8.7). Put a few drops of red fountain-pen ink in the water and stir.
ret the plant stay in the beaker for a day. Examine it the next day.
Do you observe thin red lines in the stem and leaves? If the plant
has flowers with white petals, you will notice thin red lines on the
petals also. Where did they come from? How did the red water

rise through the stem to reach the leaves?

transported (or conducted) to all parts of the
shoot system.

Modifications of the stem

Stems are modified to give support: If you
look carefully at the
gourd, grapevine and
passion flower plants,
you will find that all
of them have weak
stems. You will also
notice thin, thread-like
structures on the stems.
These are modifications of the stem and are
known as stem tendrils (Fig. 8.6). As'soon as
the tendrils touch a rough surface, they coil

FIG. 8.7 The stem transports water

Page nummber: 85
around it. In this way, weak stems find support
and go up.

Stems are modified to store food: In some
plants, the stem grows underground and stores
food. Observe a fresh piece of ginger. You can
see brown scale-like leaves on it. The ginger
that we use in food is actually an underground
stem. It is modified to store food. A potato is
also an underground stem that is modified to
store food.

a. ginger

FIG. 8.8 Underground stems that store food

Stems are modified to make
food: A Cactus plant grows in
deserts where there is very little
water. To prevent loss of water
from the surface of the leaves,
these are modified to become _
spines. It is the green stem
in the cactus that performs
all the functions performed by the leaves in
other plants, including the preparation of food
(Fig. 8.9). The stem is fleshy and can store water
for long periods.

FIG. 8.9 Cactus

THE LEAF

Look at the different parts of a leaf (Fig. 8.10).
The flat, green portion of the leaf is called the
lamina or leaf blade. It is attached to the stem
by a narrow, short stalk called the petiole.

Observe a leaf closely. Can you see some lines
on the leaf? These lines are called veins. Can you
see a thick vein in the middle of the leaf? This
vein is called the midrib. The arrangement of
veins in a leaf is called leaf venation.

FIG. 8.10 Parts of a leaf

ACTIVITY 5 (Experimental investigation)
Observe the veins in the leaves of grass,
maize or wheat—plants that have fibrous
roots. Compare them with the veins in radish,
carrot or tulsi—plants that have tap roots.
What difference do you find?

The veins in plants with fibrous roots are
parallel to each other, along the length of
the leaf. This is called parallel venation
(Fig 8.11a). In plants that have tap roots, the
veins form a net-like design, on both sides of
the leaf. This is called reticulate venation
(Fig 8.11b). The veins in a leaf transport water,
minerals and food, and also provide support to
the leaf.

a. Parallel venation b. Reticulate venation

FIG. 8.11 Types of leaf venation

Functions of the leaf

« Why are leaves green in colour? This is
due to the presence of a green pigment
called chlorophyll. Leaves make food in the
presence of sunlight with the help of water
from the soil and carbon dioxide in the

ACTIVITY 6 (Experimental investigation):
To study the various attributes of leaves
Collect leaves of different plants and examine
them. Observe the following carefully.

SIZE Some leaves are small, e.g. Acacia;
others like the banana leaf are very big.

COLOUR Are most leaves green? Have
you collected any that have spots of other
colours, e.g. Coleus?

SHAPE Leaves are of various shapes, e.g.
long and thin as in grass, long and needle-
like as in pine, circular as in water lily.

EDGES Some have smooth edges,
@.g. mango; others such as oak have jagged
edges.

ARRANGEMENT ON A BRANCH Are they
arranged separately or bunched together?

VEINS IN THE LEAVES Are they parallel to
each other, or do they emerge from a central
thicker vein?

Make a table to list each of these
attributes for the leaves you have collected.
You can use the table to recognize a plant by
its leaves.

air. Chlorophyll traps sunlight and thus
provides energy to the plant for Makin
food. This process of making food by the
leaves is called photosynthesis.

The food that the leaf prepares is a king
of sugar called glucose. The glucose ma
further change into starch before the plant
stores it. Plants use some of this food to
perform their life functions and store the
rest in fruits, roots, stems or leaves. In this
way, leaves provide food to the entire
living world.

ACTIVITY 7 (Experimental investigation):
To test for starch in green leaves
Food is made in leaves. Some food should, __
therefore, be present in all green leaves.

We can test leaves for the presence of

starch using iodine solution. When iodine
solution is added to starch, it turns
blue-black.

c. Wash in water

d. Add iodine solution |

FIG. 8.13 Testing for starch in a leaf

86 THE WORLD OF THE LIVING



Page nummber: 87
But to carry out the test, we first have
to remove the green colour of leaves. This is
called bleaching.

Take a green leaf and dip it in boiling
water in a beaker for about 10 minutes.
Next, put the leaf in a test tube, and pour

Spirit in it to completely cover the leaf.
Make the test tube stand in a beaker
containing water. Gently heat the beaker
till all the colour of the leaf comes out into
the spirit. Take out the leaf, wash it in
water and put it on a plate. Pour some
iodine solution on it. Does the leaf turn
blue-black? This shows the presence of starch
in the leaf.

Let us do another activity to show that
the starch in the leaf was made in the leaf
itself, and not received by the leaf from
some other part of the plant.

ACTIVITY 8 (Experimental investigation)
Take a potted plant and keep it in a dark
room for 24 hours. Since the leaves do not
receive sunlight, they will not be able to

' prepare food. After 24 hours, there will be no
food left in the leaf. Now cover a portion of
the leaf with a strip of black paper. Put the

_ plant in sunlight for a few hours.

Pluck the leaf and test it for starch. In
which portions of the leaf is starch present?
In which portions is it not present?

If starch is present only in the portion
that was not covered, what do you conclude?

+ Leaves also release water from the plant
through the stomata. This is called
transpiration. It helps in cooling down
the leaves. It also has another important
function. As the water escapes from
the leaves, the roots pull more water to
compensate for this loss. This water brings
with it important nutrients required by the
plant from the soil.

Transpiration plays an important role in
the water cycle, by increasing the moisture
in the air.

ACTIVITY 9 (Experimental investigation):

To study transpiration in plants
Take a healthy potted plant and water it.
Select a branch with a number of leaves, and
enclose it in a transparent polythene bag. Tie
the mouth of the bag. Take another similar
polythene bag and tie its mouth.

Keep the potted plant and the other bag
in the sun. Observe after a few hours. Can
you see water droplets in the polythene
bag covering the branch? Are there water
droplets in the other bag? Where did the
water droplets come from?

FIG. 8.14 Transpiration in plants

Modifications of the leaf

Leaves are modified to give support: If
you examine a pea or Gloriosa plant carefully
you will find
that some of the
upper leaflets
are modified
into tendrils.
The tendrils coil
around objects to
give support to the plant (Fig. 8.15).

Leaves are modified into spines: In cactus,
leaves are modified to form spines (Fig. 8.9).
This reduces loss of water from the leaves.
Spines also protect the plants from being eaten
away by the grazing animals.

- Which substances does the stem help in transporting? Name the starting points and destinations

of each substance.

, Other than the main functions that almost all stems perform, there are other specialised functions

performed by stems of some plants. Name two such plants and the specialised function performed
by their stems.

. During photosynthesis, leaves convert water and carbon dioxide to a kind of sugar called glucose. ;

If that is so, all food stored by the plant should be sweet. But this is not so. Why?

such modifications and give one example of each.

. Both stem and leaf can get modified into tendrils. True or false? If true, give one example of each.

If false, give the correct statement.

FLOWERS AND FRUITS
The most attractive part of a flowering plant is
the flower.

ACTIVITY 10 (Experimental investigation)
Collect flowers of different plants. Do not pluck
flowers from the plant. Pick only the fallen
ones. Observe them. Do they differ in their
size, shape and colour?

You can recognize a plant by its flowers.
Most flowers have a sweet smell. The smell
of some flowers is so strong that moths are
attracted to them from long distances. Some
flowers have no smell at all. Some have an
unpleasant smell.

Structure of a flower
Flowers vary in many ways. Most flowers
have the same basic structure. A typical
flower (Fig. 8.16) has a stalk called a
pedicel which joins it to the stem. The
uppermost part of the pedicel is wider “ret
and is known as the thalamus. On the
top of the thalamus, the different parts of
the flower are arranged in rings or whorls.
The outermost whorl consists of green,
leaf-like structures called sepals. These
protect the flower when it is still a bud.
Next to the sepals are the petals.
These are generally brightly coloured

and scented, to attract insects that help in
reproduction.

If we remove the petals we can see the
stamens. These are the male parts of the
flower. Each stamen consists of a thin, green
stalk or filament with a bag-like head called
the anther. The anther contains pollen grains,
which are fine dust-like particles. These take
part in reproduction.

In the centre of the flower rises a flask-
shaped structure called the pistil or carpel.
This is the female part of the flower. Its base
is slightly swollen and is called the ovary. The
short tube-like upper part is the style and above
it is the stigma. The stigma receives the pollen

Pollination

The pollen grains are transferred from the anther
to the stigma of either the same flower or of
another flower of the same kind by wind, water
or insects (Fig. 8.18). This process is known
as pollination. After pollination, the ovary
swells up and changes into a fruit and the

Plants can be classified as herbs, shrubs and trees according to their size and nature of stem,

A flowering plant has two parts—the root system and the shoot system. ‘

Tap roots have a main root from which a number of branc h roots arise. Fibrous roots are thin
fibre-like roots arising from the base of the stem. ,
Roots fix the plant to the ground, absorb water and minerals from the soil, and also bind the
soil particles together.

In some plants, roots are modified to store food, and to give extra support to the plant.

The stem keeps the plant upright, bears branches, leaves, flowers and fruits, and transports
water, minerals and food to all parts of the plant.

In some plants, stems are modified to give support, to store food and water, and to prepare food
Leaves of green plants prepare food for the rest of the living world by photosynthesis.

Leaves give out water during transpiration.

In some plants, leaves are modified into tendrils which give support to the plant. In some —
other plants, the leaves are modified into spines to reduce water loss and to protect the plant
from enemies or grazing animals.

Most flowers consist of four separate whorls with different functions.
Pollination occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma.
After pollination, the ovary swells up to become a fruit, and the ovules change into seeds.

The Body and Its Movements

ORGANIZATION AND
STRUCTURE OF THE BODY

All living things are made up of one or more
cells. For this reason, cells are known as the
structural units or the building blocks of life.
In an organism made up of only one cell
(unicellular), the single cell performs all the
activities necessary for life. In an organism made
up of many cells (multicellular), the various
life activities are performed by different groups
of cells. For example, the red blood cells in our
blood carry oxygen to all parts of the body.

A group of cells that performs a special job
together is known as a tissue. Blood, bone and
muscle are some of the tissues in your body.

For example, muscle tissues are a group of
cells, specialized to contract and expand for the
movement of body parts.

Tissues combine to form an organ. Each
organ performs some important function for
the body. For example, the heart is an organ
that pumps blood to various parts of the body.
The eye is an organ that enables you to see.
Lungs, kidneys and liver are some other organs
which perform important roles in your body.

Groups of organs work together to carry out
various life activities in our body. For example,
the food pipe, stomach, small intestine, large
intestine and some other organs together help
you to digest the food you eat. Such a group

Move your neck up and down, sideways and

in circles. Can it move in all directions? Try
moving your lower arm at the elbow. Can it
also move in all directions? Move other parts
of your body. Note which parts can move and
which parts cannot. In the parts that can
move, note the directions in which they can
move—up-down, sideways, circular. What do
you find?

Some parts of your body can move more
than others. What determines how much
movement is possible for each part? This is
determined by your bones and how they are
joined to each other. Let us study about the
bones in detail.

THE HUMAN SKELETAL SYSTEM
The bones in your body make up a framework
called skeleton. The skeleton of an adult
human being is made up of 206 bones. A child
has many more bones. But as he grows into an
adult many of the bones fuse together.

Activity 3 (Experimental investigation)
Feel the bones in your body starting from

the head. Feel the bones in your face, neck,
shoulders, arms, legs, chest, fingers, toes, etc.
Try to guess the shape and size of each bone.
Some are small, others are long; some are also
curved, Are there any parts of your body that
do not have bones? —

Functions of the skeleton
The skeleton has four main functions.
~ SUPPORT Your body has a number of soft

organs and muscles. It is necessary to have
a hard framework to support these parts,
otherwise the body will collapse. Your
skeleton provides this framework and holds
you upright.

“ PROTECTION The bones protect the soft
organs of your body. The brain is protected
by the skull; the heart and lungs by the thin
long bones in your chest called the nbs.

+ MOVEMENT Though the individual bones are
hard, several of them can move at places
where they are joined to other bones.
That is why you can move your arms, legs,
fingers, and many other parts of your body.

« MAKING BLOOD CELLS Bones are hard from
outside but they are soft and spongy on the
inside. The inside of bones contains a soft
substance called the bone marrow. Blood
cells are made in the bone marrow.

STRUCTURE OF THE

HUMAN SKELETON
The human skeleton has four basic parts—the
skull, the backbone or spine, the ribs and

The skull

The skull is the bony
structure that surrounds
and protects your brain. It
contains holes for your eyes,
ears, nose and mouth. The
upper part is made up of 8
flat bones joined together.
The face and jaw contain 14
bones. Your teeth are fixed
to the jaw bones. The lower
jaw bone is the only movable bone in the skull.
It enables you to chew your food and talk.

The backbone or spine
Press and move your
fingers along’ the centre ~
of the back of a friend.
Can you feel a long hard
bony structure which is
not very smooth? This is
the backbone. It is not
smooth because it is made
up of a number of small
bones.

The backbone consists
of 33 small bones called
vertebrae. The vertebrae
are joined to each
other. The joints allow
slight movement of the
vertebrae. This is why
you can bend and twist
your back. The backbone
is attached to the base
of the skull. It forms the central supporting
rod for the skeleton. Each vertebra has a hole
in it. The delicate organ of your body called
the spinal cord passes through these holes.
Thus, the backbone protects the spinal cord.
The backbone is also called the spine or the
vertebral column.

The rib cage

Take a deep breath and feel the bones on your
chest. Can you feel flat curved bones? These are
your ribs. The ribs are thin, flat, curved bones
that form a protective cage around the organs
in the upper part of the body. This is called
the rib cage. The rib cage consists of 24 bones
arranged in 12 pairs. All of them are joined to
the backbone at the back. ‘Most of them are
joined to the breastbone in front. The last two
pairs that are not joined to the breastbone are
called floating ribs. The rib cage protects’ the
heart and the lungs. It also protects parts of
the stomach and the kidneys. iG

your body is the thigh bone or the femur. The
lower half of the leg has the long shin bone
and calf bone. The ankles and the feet have a
number of small bones. The femur is attached
to the hip bone through the hip joint.

The upper arm has one long bone called
the humerus. The lower arm has two long
bones. The wrist and hands have several
bones. The humerus is attached to the vertebral
column through the collar bone and the
shoulder blade.

JOINTS AND MOVEMENT
The joints in the body are the places where two
bones are joined together. The joints are strong
enough to withstand jerks. The ends of bones
are covered with soft cartilage. It acts as a
shock absorber and reduces friction between the
bones. Cartilage is also present in some parts
of the body that are not as hard as the bones,
for example the upper part of the ear.

The bones are held together at the joints
by strong, stretchy bands called ligaments.
There are many joints in the body. The joints
are of three types, depending on the types of
movement they allow—immovable, slightly
movable and freely movable.

Acnviry 4 (Experimental investigation)
Move your arms at the elbow. In what
directions is movement possible? In what
directions is movement not possible?

Now move your arms at the shoulder joint.
What difference do you find? Which joint
allows more types of movement? Try the same
with movement of the legs at the knee joint
and the hip joint. Try other joints also such as
the neck, fingers and ankle.

The bones in the skull (except the lower
jaw bone) do not allow any movement.
The joints between the ribs and the breastbone
allow only slight movement. Most of the

joints in the human body are freely
movable joints. These freely movable joints are
of four main types, depending on the type of
movement they allow.

Hinge joint

The elbow, knee and finger
joints allow movement in
one plane only, that is, up
and down, or backward and
forward, like the hinges
of a door. Such joints are therefore called
hinge joints.

Fic. 9.5 Hinge joint

Ball and socket joint

The shoulder and hip joints
allow movement in all
directions. In such joints,
the end of one of the bones
is round like a ball. It fits
into a hollow part (or socket)
in the other bone. The bone
that ends in a ball, for
example, the femur or the humerus, can move
in any direction. Such a joint is called a ball
and socket joint.

Fic. 9.6 Ball
and socket joint

Pivot joint

The neck joint also
allows movement in all
directions. It allows you
to move your head up
and down, left and nght
and also to rotate it. In
such joints, one of the
bones ends in a rounded
or conical surface that
fits into a dent in the other bone. Such a joint
is called a pivot joint.

Fic. 9.7 Pivot joint

Gliding joint
The wrist or ankle joints have flattened ends

THE BODY AND ITS MOVEMENTS '@ 99


Page nummber: 100
of bones that can move
(or glide) against each
other. These joints allow
side-to-side as well as
backward and forward
movement. The vertebrae
also have similar joints
that allow slight movement. Such joints are
called gliding joints.

Fic. 9.8
Gliding joint

What makes the bones move?

Bones cannot move by themselves. It is your
muscles, attached to the bones, that make
them move at the joints. Muscles are like elastic
bands. They are attached to the bones by means
of tough connecting bands called tendons. The
muscles move the bones by their pull. Muscles
cannot push. Therefore, to move the bone in
one direction, at least two sets of muscles
are required. For example, the up and down
movements of your arm are controlled by two
muscles—biceps and triceps. When you want
to raise your arm, the biceps in front contract,
that is, they become shorter and fatter to pull
up the arm. To lower the arm, the triceps at the
back contract and pull it down.

MOVEMENT IN OTHER ANIMALS
Animals have different types of skeletons—the
skeletons of some animals do not have bones
at all! Therefore, the ways in which they move
are also different.

Earthworm
Earthworms have liquid skeletons. They have
liquid trapped in spaces inside the body. The
muscles squeeze against the liquid. This keeps
the body firm. Muscles in a worm’s body can be
squeezed differently to change the body shape.
These changes in the shape help the worm to
move along.

To move, the earthworm first extends the
front part of its body, keeping the rear part fixed
to the ground. Next, it fixes the front part and

shortens it, thus pulling the rear end forward.
It carries out such expansion and contraction of
muscles repeatedly to move forward.

Snail and cockroach

Have you seen the shell of a snail? It is
like a house it carries along with it! It is a
skeleton which is outside the body, but is not
made up of bones. Such a skeleton is known
as an exoskeleton. Crabs and insects such
as cockroaches also have exoskeletons.
Exoskeletons give support and protection and
also allow movement at the joints.

The snail has a thick structure called a foot.
It is made up of strong muscles. It produces a
series of wave-like movements that push the
snail's body forward.

Cockroaches can walk, climb and fly. They
have three pairs of legs. The leg muscles move
the legs for walking and climbing. There are
two pairs of wings attached to the breast. The
breast muscles move the wings for flying.

Fish

The skeleton of a human body is
inside the body. Such a skeleton
is known as an endoskeleton.
Fish, amphibians, reptiles,
birds and mammals have
endoskeletons. They all have
backbones and are known as
vertebrates.

Muscles that enable the fish
to move are found on either side
of the backbone. These muscles
contract on one side and expand

body from side to side, in a a CH

Zig-zag pattern. As the tail fin of
the fish moves along with the body in a zig-zag
pattern, it pushes against the water (Fig. 9.14).
This force moves the fish’s body forward.

To help movement in water, fishes have
a streamlined shape—broad in the middle and
narrow at the ends (Fig. 9.14). This reduces
the water resistance and enables the fish
to glide along in the water. Airplanes, boats
and ships also have streamlined shapes.

Fic. 9.15 Movement in snake

Snake

A snake is a vertebrate. It has a long backbone
which is very flexible. The snake can curve its
body into many loops. Each loop pushes against
the ground to give a forward push to the body,
Therefore, when moving forward, its body moves
from side-to-side in a wavelike motion.

Bird
Birds fly with their wings which are modified
forelimbs. They use their legs or hindlimbs to
walk, run and hop. Some birds also swim in water.
The bones of the birds are hollow and very
light, making it easy for them to rise in air.
Strong muscles in their breastbones help birds
to flap their wings and fly.

As we get older, our joints do not work that well. Sometimes the bones rub and grind against each
other, This causes pain and makes it difficult to move. If a disease called arthritis develops, it makes -
things worse.

In rheumatoid arthritis, the tissue grows across the joints and makes movement difficult.
Sometimes the joints can become permanently fused together and no movement is possible.

In osteoarthritis, which usually affects old people, the cartilage at the end of the bones gets worn
out. You know that cartilage acts as shock absorber. Without the cartilage, there is a lot more friction
and moyement becomes very painful. z

Sometimes an artificial joint can be used to replace a diseased joint. For example, the hip j joint can
be replaced, The rounded end of the femur is replaced by a stainless steel ball. A plastic cup replaces
the socket.
